I could see them having more and more \"bootcamps\" or \"accelerated\" programs that are way less bloated with unnecessary things you will never use in the workplace and it will take much less time to graduate.  \n\n\n Basically like trade schools or coding bootcamps are now but it will be for almost every career. In an ideal world the prices for college would plummet because of this or the government would provide free retraining programs for people displaced in the workforce.

Sure, they're going to probably be crap coders when they graduate,  but the whole point is that it was once significantly tougher to attain a degree.

This is a problem for credentialing people, which seems to be the main use of our system. Universities don't need to \"catch\" people who use AI. They need to drop them from their programs, because they are only there to get a certificate. People who don't want to learn shouldn't be in degree programs. I hope one of the upshots of AI is that people who don't want to learn leave colleges so the rest of us can enjoy them as places of learning and exploration.\n\n\nAll the slackers in high school have new ways to avoid ever learning anything, but that's not the real problem. The real problem comes later. What happens when no one wants to read something AI-generated? What happens when no one wants to look at art because it was generated by a computer? What happens to a society when citizens don't actually know anything, but can use computers to pretend that anything is true?\n\nIt's not just the education system.

I can get some great Bicep or Terraform out of it, or sometimes it's terrible. And even at its best, I've had to doublecheck to discover issues like the template trying to assign an incorrect, overly-permissive role to an identity in Azure, which would have presented a security risk. At the same time, it was telling me in comments that it had assigned the expected, requested role.\n\nAre they getting better all the time? Sure. Are product owners going to all suddenly become prompt engineers, replacing the need for developers on their team? It's all about subject matter expertise. Product owners won't produce the best product vision if they're worried about tactical details like getting AI to give them the code they need.

Certainly people taking short cuts for learning is always bad. But taking short cuts to save labor could be a positive. Like it or not, AI is here to stay. \n\nThere have always been existential crises over new technology in education. Spell check and pocket calculators. Cursive vs. keyboarding. The internet and copy/paste plagiarism.\n\nBut truthfully, other than a wave of students taking shortcuts as schools try to figure out how to adjust, we don't really know the role AI will play in education or beyond. \n\nAll we know is that it's going to be pretty prominent, and there will be an increasing need for people to know how to use it effectively. Schools will probably respond to this and do a generally shit job of it, in much the same way the system has poorly responded to teaching students how to do things like code or even use Google Suite. \n\n>Now, I feel like way more people are likely to finish and not drop out. \n\nMaybe, but this is pretty speculative and sounds like anxiety over this change taking over your thoughts. If coding students are using AI and not learning how to code, how will they handle the demands of the workplace? What happens when AI fails them? \n\nI would tell a student in your position to worry about your own learning. You can't control what other people do, you can't control what schools will or won't do. Just take care of yourself and your own back yard. Learn your subject material and - if the schools aren't teaching you - learn how to use AI resources responsibly and ethically.",

But the world evolves, and today a student who knows how to use AI to go beyond what they were previously capable of is, IMO, a student who’s prepared. More so than one who was denied access to those tools, but knows really well manual essay writing, or getting square roots by hand. \n\nIn the end, I also think the smartest and most curious students will go back to learn the fundamentals: calculus, logarithms, creative writing, painting, music, etc. And if both them and the slackers have tools to maximize productivity, more power to all of them.",

You see the “teaching needs to adapt to it” thing a lot which isn’t…wrong, but I think this idea has led to a lot of poor outcomes when it involves swapping existing skills for technology. “Why learn times tables when you have a calculator in your pocket? Why memorize history facts when you can just look it up? Why teach handwriting/cursive when they can just type? Why focus on spelling and grammar when spell check and grammarly exist?” \n\nI would bet that you’ll see a movement away from teaching writing in the next 5 or so years. It might not stick everywhere but I still think it’ll happen - combining the AI factor with a more general push in the last 20 years towards career/job skills being paramount and it’s easy to see writing go the way of some of the other humanities.",

A little late to respond but I would love to leave my thoughts below.  \n  \nWith regards to answering your question about AI use in education, I feel like in the case that you presented, yeah. Using AI to just get answers with no thought in understanding why those are the answers can be detrimental to a student's development in critical thinking / problem solving.  \n  \nSaying that though, if used correctly AI can be a great tool for helping students to develop those critical thinking / problem solving skills.   \n  \nFor example, If one is trying to solve a difficult problem, one can use clever prompting techniques to get the AI to generate thought provoking hints which can help guide the student in solving the problem.  \n  \n**Example**  \n1. 2x + 3y = 12  \n2. x - y = 1  \n  \n***ChatGPT Generated Hint:*** *\"Instead of jumping to solve for x or y, think about what it means for these two lines to intersect. How would finding one variable help you understand the relationship between these two lines\"*  \n  \nThis is just one of many examples and some Edtech companies are starting to take advantage of the AI's capabilities (Ex: CK-12's use of generative hints in their practice problems set)  \n  \nI hope this helps. :D",

It’s not infallible but still very useful however it can also be taken too far as we all know.\n\nAI is requires a far greater degree of change than previous advancements to be properly implemented into education  and honestly I’m not sure how long it will take for that to realistically happen or if it will even happen at all as warring against AI is a at least in the short term easier option",

I’m a coder and know that I will be eventually replaced, but there is a lot on that list that is getting replaced before coders.  Coders will not be the first job that AI makes useless, but I’m also not planning on being a coder for my entire career.\n\nAlready, our marketing team is using AI for video narration and not hiring voice actors anymore. Page copy is being written by AI. Video is being edited by AI. A ton of stuff that we used to contract out are now done by us in-house. \n\nPeople who think coders will be the first job to go don’t realize that there are A LOT of jobs that are already being replaced TODAY.\n\nTBH, legacy spaghetti code bases are a big reason coders will stick around  for a while. Same reason why COBOL programmers are still highly sought after even though it’s a dead language.\n\nA lot of other reasons too, but kinda hard to explain without making this comment unnecessarily long. Like, I still think there will be programmers in the future, but not with the same skill set  as today. Which is still true when you look at programming now versus decades ago. Constantly changing field that really does require less and less hard technical skills as time goes by, but significantly more soft skills. ",

And yes, I think AI definitely pushes us to rethink traditional structures by focusing more on skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability.

I know plenty of really good writers who are dogs-poop under pressure. They think brilliant thoughts, they write brilliant prose, but they collapse under pressure.\n\nGranted, there are jobs where you need to have a good piece of writing done in a time-frame, but most jobs aren't those, and so putting the screws to someone (you must finish in one hour) is a pressure point that some students feel that others do not, which is pretty unfair.

AI just goes beyond them and leaves them behind. \n\nThe point of manual essay writing was to actually teach things like critical thinking, analysis, and texts in conversation. Students would receive assignments that required them to read publications by scientists and then formulate a paper response based on their reading. The essay was a medium for deeper learning, and now it's just a thing computers do instead of students.\n\n>And if both them and the slackers have tools to maximize productivity, more power to all of them.\n\nWell, but what we're finding out is that the slackers have the same \"output\" as the curious students.

They don’t know how to discern right from wrong and have absolutely no grasp on the limits of AI and that it can be incorrect. Without writing essays the old fashioned way and developing those skills you can’t just learn how to use AI the correct way. Calculators have been around for decades. Calculus textbooks have been around for hundreds of years. A majority of people still struggle with middle school level math. \n\nIf you drop off math past long division say goodbye to 95% of engineers, doctors, computer programmers, and tons of other professions. Math class is the best way to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills. Even if the students won’t be factoring quadratics in their day to day life (they won’t) they will practice analyzing a problem and using previous knowledge to solve it. Math and science class is really the only class where students are given problems and they have to work correctly to arrive at an answer. And to be successful in class you have to do that repeatedly and be consistently accurate. Having that ability is invaluable in any field.",

One thing we hear over and over is that ChatGPT and Copilot enables them to learn new frameworks or even programming languages much faster than before. Granted, the target population is grownups who already have a solid understanding of software and code.\n\nI definitely share your concern, and what you say is not wrong.

You cannot program without having an innate understanding of logic, which is essentially what math boils down to.\n\nUsing a calculator for everything is terrible for brain development and is hindering our students. “Simple” math that even adults who say they’re bad at math is stumping kids now. I am a math teacher and I have several 18 year old seniors who cannot add or subtract, let alone multiply or divide without their phone calculator.

I don’t care if my students know how to factor a quadratic 20 years from now. What I want is for my students to see an example of a problem, work through a handful of problems with me or through some resource, then see a new problem of the same type and say “oh, this is just like those other problems” and solve it the same way.

Normally time is not a factor in writing (except on Reddit) and so we want to see what people are *actually* capable of, and not just what they can produce in an hour. If anything, I wish people would slow down and *think* for a few minutes *before* they write… this thread is already full of answers to objections people have raised that others are missing because they see a single bit and leap at it. \n\nAnd I do it as well!

Imagine I assigned a paper on Napoleon and then took off a bunch of points because of your handwriting. \n\nLook, you just got a “B” because of your handwriting instead of the “A” that actually reflects your knowledge. When we assess students, we’re trying to assess the actual skill we’re looking at. \n\n(Which is not to say that presentation isn’t important, but if it is, I should be telling you ahead of time…)\n\nLook, if you’re an educator, you know this already and I don’t need to tell you. If you’re not an educator, this is one of the things we think about. If my job is to teach you X, and you’re bad at Y, your inability to do Y should not factor into your assessment of X. \n\nNow sometimes they’re linked! If you’re standing up in front of the room and you are supposed to give a presentation on Napoleon, and you have a horrible stutter, I should give you two grades: your content knowledge and your presentation skill. And maybe, if you have a disability, we don’t count that towards your grade. \n\nIt’s more complicated than most people think it is, and *if* we decide that doing the work in a short time period is important than we can teach that—but I think (as I’ve said elsewhere) that rarely do we need to do something like writing on a clock. \n\nDo we time painters? Or do we care about the quality of the product? Those are questions we should define as schools/educators/society. I can teach kids whatever we decide, but (at the moment) we’ve decided that time is not a factor. \n\n(Almost every student on an IEP or 504 has “extended time” as an accommodation, and you better believe if we start requiring time, nearly every student will abruptly have mommy and daddy getting them on a 504…)",

No, but that's not what we're dealing with.\n\nFrom one of my better freshmen:\n\n>Protective parents are now banning books that were part of the backbone of your education.

This is an epidemic of parents with the right motive, but the wrong idea. Protecting children is important, but not from their education. These books should never have been banned from schools, especially ones like *To Kill a Mockingbird*.\n\nThere is a ton of things I could suggest to this student to make this better. I'll suggest two or three, because that's about as much as a person can take in during a single sitting. Also, the kid will be welcome to rewrite if they don't like their score, and I'll happily work with them on it.\n\nBut AI can definitely write that, and I can tell you that it's better than about 90% of the students in the room, and it's one of the best high schools in the country—Top 500 in US News and World Reports.\n\nImagine how good a grade a kid could get at a lower school with lower standards.

What I'm suggesting is that a combination of understanding how to use GenAI, AND having previous knowledge in a subject area, would allow a student to minimize the number of tokens used. Less understanding in either area would cost more tokens. If grades are based on an inverse ratio to tokens consumed, the students who both know the tool and the subject matter area best are going to get the highest grades.\n\n(basic not real example here) \"Write me an essay about Shakespeare\" is going to take a lot more iterations and tokens to get to a usable result than something more like, \"Write me an essay about Shakespeare using \\[x\\] tone, using these sources \\[x, y, z\\] as a reference, that use his works \\[x, y, z\\] that demonstrate Francis Bacon may have been Shakespeare. You will consider factors \\[x, ,y, z\\] and you will iterate on the logic of why Shakespeare could be Bacon until I am satisfied with the results.\"",

Are we comfortable allowing a program, written by someone we don’t know, owned by a company that doesn’t have our interests at heart, become the voice of the next generation because we never taught them how to effectively communicate for themselves?\n\nCan I subscribe to your blog or something? I've been trying to get this point across for months. Literacy isn't AI writing and AI writing isn't literacy. \n\nImagine if you had a machine that could simulate a body in perfect health, and you brought it to your next checkup. Your doctor checks the machine, declares you in perfect health, and never actually looks at your real body. That's sort of where we are in education. We've got a cool new machine that says \"no problem here!\" Whenever we remove that machine, we can tell that we're in big trouble. But hey, maybe this is the simulacra that saves us.",

You should be evaluating their writing ability.  I’m a chemist and when I evaluated lab reports, I always reserved a few points (very minor) for evaluating their writing ability, since the whole point of a report is to clearly communicate what you did.  There weren’t enough points allocated for writing to make a difference in the overall grade, but they were sometimes the difference between a very good paper and a nearly perfect paper.   \n\nAside from teaching for almost 3 decades, I also spent 20 years in the military (half of that was as a professor at the Academy) and I also spent several years working in industry before that, and started working as a teenager on farms and in restaurants, so I know the value of both the ability to do a job well and to do it in a timely manner. \n\nDo we time painters?  Sure we do.  As well as plumbers and HVAC technicians and restaurant workers, and farmer worker, etc., etc.  Ask a farmer if they care about speed or accuracy?  The answer will be “both”.  Do you care if your meal at a restaurant is brought within 30 minutes or 2 hours?  If you hire someone to paint your house, do you care if they get it done in a few days or if they’re still there after a year and haven’t yet finished? **Completing work in a timely manner is a very important aspect of** ***most*** **jobs, contrary to your contention that** “rarely do we need to do something like writing on a clock”**.**\n\nSo, back to your initial idea that we need to be clear about what we are grading:  you need to be clear with your writing students that you are evaluating their writing ability, not their knowledge of whatever they are writing about, or at least that your evaluation of their knowledge will be a small portion of the points.  Just as I was clear with my chemistry students about evaluating mostly their chemistry knowledge but also  (a bit) of their writing ability.  Of course, the test assignment needs to be reasonable in length and aimed at the center of the range of abilities, just like we generally construct any evaluation.  The better students will do better and the struggling students will do worse, but that’s how evaluations are.  And if students have a 504, then they should get extra time - it’s not the teacher’s job to judge whether a student needs accommodation or not.  That’s the job of the proper authorities and they need to make sure that accommodations are not handed out unjustifiably.",

I worry the students with empathy problems might not respect the robots and might damage them instead of learning empathy from the robot.\n\nI’m deeply concerned for the safety of the robots. When the robots need to break up a fights something might go wrong. One student might push the robot onto another student as the robots tries to get up it crushes an innocent child. Another student will film it on their phone.\n\nIt will be worse than the revolt in Minneapolis over the death of George Floyd. Parents will come to the schools to destroy the robots.\n\n\nI think it will take a while to get that far. The early models will suffer through a lot of pranks. Kids will find ways to get the robot wet , paint the robot, trip the robot.\n\nYou did mention having humans as care takers that support the robot’s class. In most situations these care takers won’t be allowed to physically stop the students from damaging the Robots. Most training programs and district policies don’t allow physical restraints to protect property the care takers will need to say “robot the children are planing on painting you”.

This will provide some challenges for teachers to detect depending on the amount of work teachers want to put in. Low effort students who want to turn in their assignments might not even read what chat GPT wrote and chat GPT may narc on them. Motivated high effort students may use it as a tool and edit it to match their voice. This will likely be impossible for teachers to catch given that teachers will rely on free tools or tools provided by the district which will be obsolete. \n\nLong term, AI might be beneficial at providing students with scaled materials that push then just hard enough. I think that this could take forever though. If you were a programmer, you'd likely want to spend time making products for the financial sector or insurance sector in order to make the most money. Lesser quality products with flashy marketing will be pushed to school districts who will gobble it up. I think this will be analogous to internet and computer capabilities. The Internet has been in the private market for nearing 3 decades, however, schools are just now getting to 1:1 ratios where as corporations have been at that level for the whole time. \n\nFinally, with regards to the last factor, will AI replace teachers? I think if the pandemic taught us anything, it's that students need to be in the care of teachers in order to be successful. Students will not do the work on their own. They'll jailbreak their devices to get back to their short form dopamine hits and people will demand that they get back to traditional classrooms.",

However, might the role of AI in education be more analogous to mobile phones rather than computers?\r  \n\r  \nMobile phones were brought into classrooms by students themselves and became an immediate part of daily life. Similarly, AI tools could be rapidly integrated by students, eager to enhance their learning, rather than following the slow, institution-led path of computers.\r  \n\r  \nI agree with your insights on the potential and challenges of AI, but I wonder if the student-driven approach might lead to a more immediate impact, akin to the mobile phone revolution. How do you see the role of students in driving this integration, and do you think it might unfold more quickly than you initially suggested?",

The observation that society's reliance on schools for childcare has made them irreplaceable by software is an astute one, and I deeply admire your clarity on this subject.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, your comment also prompts me to think about the broader implications of AI on the job market, as highlighted in the original paper. As AI continues to impact various professions, it could potentially lead to job losses and a shift in the traditional work structure. This might result in more parents being at home, negating the need for schools to function as childcare providers.\r  \n\r  \nIf this were to occur, how do you think it would affect the school system and education as a whole? Would it allow for a more focused approach to education, free from the constraint of also needing to provide childcare? Or might it present new challenges as the role of schools in society evolves?

This will likely be impossible for schools to catch and even if they use an ai detection tool, you'll have some parents say, you can't prove my kid didn't write this. It won't be worth it for schools to pursue this. It's too much money for the tool and too much of a headache for admins. \n\nYou'll also have low effort students who will type the prompt into chat GPT or the like, and not even bother to read what was written. In the response, it might say something along the lines of, as an ai I didn't have a summer vacation, but going to the beach is often a favorite activity for people to do around the world... \n\nSomeone might write a predictive text generator that doesn't ever refer to itself as such, and then it'll be really tough for schools to handle. \n\nOne response I've heard is using all pencil and paper for written responses. I don't think it'll have much staying power and it'll come with it's own difficulties. Kids could say, I turned it in and then you can't fully prove that they didn't. Etc.",

As the models will immediately point out, if you are concerned about a medical issue you need to get advice from a trained doctor, whether the issue seems serious or not. Not to mention a lot of the time you will not be able to access appropriate treatment without the recommendation of a doctor.\n\nDo not trust ChatGPT with your health, it may score better than most doctors on an exam, this does not mean it performs better than a doctor in practice, and unless you're a doctor you won't be able to spot errors.",

It's essentially an interactive wikipedia that can effortlessly explain topics for you at a level you can understand whether you're in first grade or going for an advanced degree. In addition to everything else it can do. One of the biggest predictors of academic success is how much individual attention teachers can give to each student.

(I worked on LLMs before most of you were out of Uni ;) )\n\nThe problem is that higher education is very formulaic, partly due to the ease and familiarity, partly due to regulatory pressure from governing bodies. If you are to be a medical doctor, you have to jump through hoops X, Y and Z in line with those bodies. A lot of those hoops are designed to have students demonstrate their 'understanding' about a topic by writing about it extensively (essays/reports). \n\nThis has always been a bad way to assess, but is now under even more pressure. To change the system will take time but AI is here now, available in large numbers and more capable than most could have predicted. \n\nThere are two major hurdles to overcome: \n\nDesigning excellent, appropriate assessment requires a lot of thinking about the way you teach and what you want your students to take away. After all, you have to be inclusive, ie. all students should have an equal chance of a good grade. But many higher education lecturers have never even followed a certification level qualification on education, let alone assessment. So they find it incredibly difficult to step away from the 'ten lectures with powerpoint, 4 workshops and 6 group tutorials, followed by an essay and maybe a presentation' meta.\n\nCreative forms of assessment need to be approved by the University teaching bodies, the governing bodies and the student unions. It is very common for more creative lecturers to become bottled up because someone, somewhere, decides that it has to be in the meta as described above. \n\nExample: I used to teach information architecture to yr 3 UG students. When I started I was given ten presentations, a module handbook and that was it. None of it was up to date, none of it actually matched what I understood about IA. So I wanted to mix it up, I wanted students to build physical models of information, using 3d objects. This was to be their assessment alongside a report describing the model in detail. \n\nI got told no by every single committee going. Why? Because they felt the students wouldn't understand. The truth was that they didn't understand, but senior professors can't admit to that now, can they...",

It is up to the educational institute to understand the tools available to its students and create difficult or challenging assignments and exams to gauge understanding. This can be done in many ways that are not influenced by an AI tool. I was in school when \"graphics\" calculators were still allowed in exams, allowing people to store examples and text in the calculator they brought into exams. Was this cheating? Nope, fully allowed. Did the rules change the following year to only allow scientific calculators or change the exams to be written in a different way such that it wasn't so focused on wrote or textbook examples? Yes. We adapt to use tools better in every way, not hamstring their use.",

Students aren't using AI to *learn*—they're using it to circumvent the need to *study.* And just so we're clear...if I were still a student, I might do the same thing.\n\nSo far, AI is extremely useful at automating the clerical side of teaching. Students have poor handwriting? Use an AI tool to decipher it and render it into something the teacher can read. Need simple exercises in arithmetic for students who are progressing slower than the textbook? Use an AI to generate those.\n\nBut the actual **teaching**? Unlikely. In all the thought experiments I've run and conversations I've had with educators who are aware, the use of AI tools *in the classroom* (where the students are calling each other names, throwing paper balls at each other, etc.) is actually quite limited. Can it help you explain your topic better? Probably (because it can also explain it worse). Will it cause your students to *care?* Of course not. You're on your own there.\n\nThe social aspect of teaching: Bonds formed via learning and solving problems together with your friends and peers, someone sparking curiosity in a field which previously was of no interest to you, etc., simply cannot be replicated by an AI. You use it once you know what you want/need. Using it before that just results in waffling.\n\nYes, if all teaching is is the transfer of knowledge, then sure, an AI could do it, and if one is that kind of teacher, then one ought to fear for one's future prospects. You wouldn't even need an AI, really. Students have been attending \"YouTube University\" for many years now.\n\nBut that only works if someone already *wants* to learn about a particular thing. Any educator who has actually gotten down and dirty in the trenches will know that that's not how students are—at least those students who are not yet in college. The vast majority of students in and of themselves don't *want* to learn what were teaching them—we have to *convince and persuade* them to, and often not via logic and reasoning, but via compassion, empathy, and by being good role models.",

What will they use to complete *that* assignment? \n\nThe fact is that AI gives students a good reason to be apathetic about reading and writing. Why learn to do something that a computer can do in no time at all? Why read something that may turn out to be a rumor started by a machine? \n\nEveryone in education, k-12 and post-secondary should prepare for the coming bloodbath. This is a free machine that your local would-be homeschoolers can use to keep their kids away from school shooters, bullying, and dissenting ideas.

For example, I used AI twice recently to help create mock trial scenarios to learn judicial processes and mock election scenarios to learn about campaigns and elections. True, I could have done that manually, but the time required to create high quality projects would have far exceeded what is available given all the other responsibilities teachers have. The projects used students’s preferences for competitive and collaborative work to drive them to use textbook information to complete high quality projects, mastering the content along the way. Open to any and all ideas about using it to create similarly engaging ELA projects that help students enjoy the process of mastering ELA standards, since I’ll have three more ELA classes this coming year.",

Educators, though they may not know it, are no longer in the business of communicating factual information. They are, or should be, in the business of teaching the kids how to learn. That can be done just as readily when teaching them what they want to know about as it can with classical subjects. I knew a guy who wasn't a very good student, but loved jazz. He had a whole wall filled with albums, and knew everything about the players. At some point he got some coaching and became a recording engineer. If he had run into an excellent teacher, he might have become the best recording engineer ever, but of course his teachers knew he needed to learn other stuff. Teachers may think they know what a student needs to learn, but in fact they don't have a clue. They don't know what the future is going to be like. Nobody anticipated social media or smartphones or AI.  In the early 20th century, America committed to industrialists' insistence that schools teach the skills necessary for factories to operate, rejecting the followers of John Dewey, who wanted child-centered education. They also fixed it so teachers had no power and bureaucrats had it all., just  like in a factory. It's about time to correct that mistake. Schools need to educate kids according to their interests and talents; they do not need to prepare them for jobs. If corporations want their workers to have specific skills, they can damned well pay for training, as they used to do via apprenticeships, rather than expecting schools to do it, while they evade the taxes that support schools. \n\n I know, I know, teachers have to do what they're told, teach to the test, get results that their superiors accept. But if AI totally disrupts education, maybe it will be possible to start teaching toward a gig economy, to give students the skills to make their own way without becoming corporate puppets. Convincing them, persuading them, to learn what you think they should learn isn't necessary. Find out what they want to learn and coach them. If what you think they should know is really important, they'll encounter it and know how to learn it.",

But it also means that the classroom needs to offer what YouTube cant, but also make students aware of the great resources so they can use them in addition to what the classroom offers.  \n\nOr with social media being a thing, Artists need to learn how to evaluate their own art on their own terms, and not based on external factors that muddy the waters such as likes and follows. (which are based on a LOT more than simply \"quality\" of art).  Or learning the importance of developing an idea, iterating on it, and learning and growing with the piece rather than only trying to put only \"what's in their head\" on the page.  Using art as a language to communicate, and explore ideas.\n\nI think this is even more apparent with AI.  So many people suddenly have to grapple with making faulty comparisons to other's art.  Or \"why do art at all if the ai can do it better?!\" These types of topics are important.    \n\nWhich I don't think anything has really changed in that regard, but I think communication and focus needs to shift to emphasize those points a bit more, because too many people are really struggling and seemingly never learned how to deal with those ideas.\n\nAs far as VR goes, I think there is some really cool potential there.  From each student being at a location of their choosing, to being a bit more immersed in their work by removing distractions.  I think the possibilities are quite interesting.\n\nI'm not a teacher, so take everything I said with a grain of salt.",

As we get more and more technology in our lives, I think people find hand made work appealing as a contrast. There is something meditative about focusing on one’s craft. Art was a big part of how we evolved as a species. It is so deeply a part of what makes us human that I think it would take thousands of years for us to evolve away from the drive to create. \n\nI also think it will keep a large emphasis on conceptual art as the act of creation (for some artists) becomes determining the appropriate prompts for AI to execute.

If analog is becoming more accessible, what do you think is happening to other sub-disciplines that are naturally more accessible than analog, RF, etc?\n\nAn EE won’t be wholesale replaced by a robot, but a sophisticated tool can make an EE *easier* to replace while also raising expectations for what an EE should be able to accomplish. That rising standard means that EEs need to be trained more to be effective, and that burden of training is more and more shifted onto the new EE (ie college) as opposed to the industry itself.",

Trawling 'the web' for your training model is not going to yield accurate results. If you put rubbish in you get rubbish out. \n\nI foresee a whole breed of new companies that specialize in training AI models on very specific and carefully selected material. Their offerings will be subscription based (of course) just like Altium Designer, so if you want the best you have to pay.\n\nThe AI models from these companies will be good, but it will cost you.\n\nThere really is an opportunity here for many new startups, and it will take startup cash because the training material will not be free. IP owners and book authors will want their cut. We're already seeing this in the courts now.\n\nAs always, there will be a free alternative like linux that uses open source training material. It will start out way behind everyone else, but get better over time to the point where it's fairly good and good enough for most people.",

I agree that education in the U.S. needs a dramatic overhaul, but unfortunately I think AI (at this stage) will only offer students additional conveniences to already established resources, not necessarily change the system as a whole. \n\nTo give a couple of examples, as mentioned by another user, AI could be used as a personal tutor or even a professor on-call, but tutoring services have always existed and professors (hopefully) can be reached by email or during office hours for questions. In this case, AI has reduced the time and energy needed to seek tutoring and ask questions, but the assistance, more or less, has always been there. \n\nLikewise, as far as AI teaching courses/skills is concerned, we've had access to free self-study massive open online courses (MOOCs) for decades, not to mention free online tutorials, Wikipedia, etc. At this point, anyone passionate and disciplined enough can cobble together free courses that would equal a college degree, at least as far as knowledge is concerned. But, I think it's important to note, MOOCs have a dropout rate of 90+%, so most people are not passionate or disciplined enough to finish a single free course, let alone an entire degree. \n\nIn both of these examples, AI is compiling what we've already had access to but presenting it in a more convenient package. As an educator, the optimist in me thinks AI will encourage students to want to learn more and dive deeper into topics. For the students who struggle for whatever reason (including poor teaching), AI can be used to supplement materials. \n\nThe pessimist in me, on the other hand, thinks little will change. The students who are driven to ask questions and seek self-improvement, would do so with or without AI. If anything, my concern is the struggling students will use AI more as a crutch than as a tool. As jokingly mentioned elsewhere in the tread, critical thinking may be on the chopping block. \n\nWith all that being said, I do think AI will positively impact how courses are taught. My prediction, depending on the discipline, instead of building a skill or lesson from the ground up, courses will rely more on reverse engineering. AI will produce completed program scripts, essays, research, etc. and it will be the student's task to deconstruct what the AI built and ask, how and why it was built this way, and how it could be built differently. This already happens to a certain extent but AI will amplify it.\n\ntldr; AI will be amazing for students who are already motivated. It may cause more harm than help to students who not motivated. Hopefully it will result in professors creating more engaging content. The drop in total number of students attending college in 2025 will have a larger impact on universities than AI (at this point).",

(for K-12, I dearly hope kids continue to gain social skills in schools via in person interactions with peers and with live human teachers, especially if both parents are working outside the home most days) .\n\nHowever, it’s not just about the technology itself, but how it integrates into the complex social dynamics of learning and aspiration.\n\nOne aspect often overlooked in discussions about educational change is the role of social aspiration, especially in higher education. For many, the choice of university is influenced by a desire to emulate societal 'betters,' seeking prestige as much as education. This pursuit is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills, but also about building personal networks and social status, often seen in the halls of elite universities.\n\nCurrently, the prestige of American universities, particularly the Ivy Leagues and other elite institutions (the \"Public Ivies\"), hinges significantly on their appeal to wealthy and powerful families. The demand for these institutions remains high as they offer more than just academic knowledge - they are hubs for networking, career opportunities, and even social matchmaking (AKA assortative mating).\n\nHowever, as AI continues to advance, we must consider how it could disrupt this dynamic. If AI-driven education platforms can offer comparable or superior knowledge and skill development, the traditional university model might face challenges. The key question is: When will the world's wealthiest families start to perceive AI-enhanced education as a better option for their children, not just professionally, but in terms of the broader social benefits currently offered by elite universities?\n\nThe change might not be immediate. Elite universities are known for their adaptability and may well integrate AI into their systems to maintain their appeal. But the potential for AI to democratize access to high-quality education could shift the landscape. It might create a scenario where elite-level education is accessible to a broader audience, thereby changing the traditional dynamics of educational prestige and social aspiration.\n\nIn conclusion, while the demand for traditional university education remains strong, driven by social and aspirational factors, the rise of AI in education could herald a shift in this landscape. The future of higher education may well involve a blend of traditional prestige and innovative, AI-driven learning methods.",

We can, theoretically, outperform machines if we tap into our quantum powers. Practically, we lost our spunk.  But we should learn how to learn, and this goes into general intelligence.  I am curious about AGI and if that negates our uniqueness. Does general intelligence have an algorithm that is duplicable (I know, bad word) by machines to replicate?  Education lost its way when ppl required memorization.  Rather, critical thinking will be more important in our adaptation.  Our problem with education is it’s not dynamic, very flat footed and stationary.  And we tend to emphasize the ego to promote those who figured it out earlier than others.  When education is truly about learning and the world does away with pride, maybe then education will be more natural and easier to share. Today, it’s more of a minimum competency institution than one that promotes intelligence.  Having that all said, education is not the sole responsibility of the institution. People have to understand that they have a responsibility to push themselves forward.",
