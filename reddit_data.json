And for decent reasons, I have to admit - I am actually pessimist regarding the short term developments, I think next 10 years or so will be terrible. \n\n\n In spite of all that, and especially in spite of the climate (the biggest problem), the total sum of my convictions is long term optimism. To be honest I don't have any short, easily digestible summaries out there - like I said, it's a total sum od my intuitions. ",

The biggest thing holding them back is government corruption, and the younger generations in these countries are sick of their shit and pushing back. There will be political turmoil but they will come out the other side in a good position to become a prominent manufacturing core for the global economy.",

The war will be a phyrric victory for China after China orients (no pun intended) its domestic manufacturing capability for a wartime economy.  The decades after will see demographic collapse and political instability in China, as their unaddressed demographic inversion bears fruit, compounded by the economic costs of the war and their limited international partners.  The destruction of semiconductor plants in Taiwan, and the brain drain after the war, will spur innovation and development in semis in more stable countries. \n\nAfter a period of upheaval, a new more liberal China will emerge, and produce great philosophical and cultural works.\n\nGenerally, the world will be much more culturally homogenous due to the Internet, and will mirror US culture and politics due to the early and high Internet penetration in the US.\n\nSome regions will be left behind economically, specifically those with illiberal, corrupt, and/or authoritarian governments, often in the global south.  EU zone counties will lag behind in growth relative to USA for demographic and political reasons, to the point that the difference is obvious.\n\nAmerican leftists will still talk about free healthcare in \"those European countries\".\n\nIndia will struggle with corruption and weak state capacity for several decades, but eventually experience explosive growth in domestic wealth.\n\nFollowing the death of Putin, Russia will slowly deteriorate due to internal political tensions and an apathetic, apolitical population, eventually breaking up or reorganizing its federal structure.  Despite this, they will continue to lose relative ground economically.\n\nSouth America will quietly become wealthy, important global trade partners, but have very limited geopolitical ambitions.  They will (with some exceptions) be increasingly internally and externally stable.\n\nIsrael will be one of the benefactors of the destruction of TSMC and become one of the leaders in chip production.  A political solution will be reached to the IP conflict and nobody will be happy about it.\n\nThere will be general political and economic stability.  USA will experience at least one 25 year period of economic growth with no recessions.\n\nEconomists will vehemently disagree about the reasons why.\n\nDemographics will be the leading political issue.  Immigration, especially as it relates to demographic realities, will be a leading issue especially in Europe w.r.t. central/south African immigrants.  Europe will take a more populist xenophobic turn.\n\nAmerican leftists will still refer to America as the most racist country on earth.\n\nReproduction be subsidized until after artificial wombs show up in the late 2060s\n\nHuman healthspan will start to dramatically increase, leading to questions regarding retirement age, old age benefits, and labor force participation rates.\n\nUrbanization will accelerate, with many remote rural areas (in e.g. Appalachia) being abandoned and rewilded.  This will be a general, global phenomenon.  New mega cities will emerge in India, southeast Asia, Africa, and south America, as well as few in USA.\n\nIslamic fundamentalism will hamstring Islamic countries, isolating them and damaging their growth (e.g. by limiting women in the workforce).  Saudi Arabia will not build the goofy wall city to completion, and will slowly bleed wealth and influence as oil becomes more irrelevant and cheaper to extract domestically for many countries.\n\nWe will pass the 2c warming threshold.  Globally we will succeed in the green energy transition, with the majority of global energy coming from distributed, small scale wind and solar projects.\n\nNuclear bros will still insist that fission energy is necessary to cover baseload requirements.  Environmentalists will still insist that a population destroying apocalypse is around the corner.\n\nCommercial fusion will continue to be 10 years away at all times.\n\nEducation globally will be supplemented by personalized AI tutors within the next 20 years, benefitting the poorest countries the most, leading to large catch up growth over the following decades.\n\nChess will still be popular.\n\nGenerally we will be happier, healthier, wealthier, and more peaceful, with some speed bumps along the way.",

At this point, I am unsure how organized the U.S. military response will be, but the homelands of most of these nations will suffer terrible damage and many amongst their populations will die. \n\nAfter seeking revenge on what remains of Russia, the remnants of the U.S. military will take up territory in South America. \n\nWith the West out of the picture, the Middle East will begin their final conflict amongst themselves for religious  supremacy. \n\nChina will stay out of the fighting and absorb the eastern half of Russia, since they do not wish to waste their investments in that region, such as the pipelines in Scandinavia and the docks along the arctic sea. The far east will focus on establishing new alliances amongst themselves in order to safeguard against potential Chinese aggression that will not come, and an Era of peace will exist in that region.\n\n\nIndia will continue to rise both economically and militarily and be at the center of a new alliance that takes in many nations from across the globe, partaking in humanitarian missions to help the remains of the middle east and Europe, as well as exploiting third world countries for much needed resources. Desalination techniques will be heavily invested into and perfected by the Indian alliance to deal with the global water crisis. \n\n\nChina will see a vast increase economically as well and begin investing heavily into cloning technology to deal with their declining population. Many of the problems that currently exist in China will grow much worse as workers lose their leverage of labor to clones and increased automation. Civil unrest in China will come to a fever pitch and grow into open rebellions. The PRC will grow tired of their citizens not complying and begin to round their natural born citizens into death camps. \n\nThe wholesale slaughter of the Chinese people by its own government will trigger fear and outrage by the remaining nations, and the Indian alliance will be forced to invade. Nuclear war between those two groups will devastate most of the world's remaining power structures. \n\nThen the groups ultimately responsible for orchestrating all of these conflicts will finally emerge from their subterranean cities, groups with advanced technologies far superior to anything any of us have ever seen and begin to conquer and enslave the remains of the planet.",

I hope I'm wrong about everything I'm about to post...\n\n\"The Sino-Russian War will begin on the west coast of America. Russia will attack Washington, Oregon, and northern California, and China will take southern California. \nRussia has plans for America's energy sector, while China wants to control trade. They will both share in food supplies.\nThe invaders will use small tactical nukes and bioweapons to take out enemy combatants. The U.S. military immediately jumps into action but is met with heavy firepower and pushback from the invaders. Gun owning Americans are encouraged to join the fighting to defend the country, and sign up in the millions. \n\nAmerican politicians who welcome our new invaders/overlords will be met with death by firing squad by the U.S. government. The Chinese state that they would like to begin talks, to which the U.S. president refuses to attend. \n\nThe Battle of Topeka is especially bloody. Tens of thousands on both sides are killed in a matter of hours. \n\nThe Chinese offer original Mexican territory back to Mexico, and since their government is jingoist (following in the U.S.'s footsteps) they accept, retaking New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Texas. \n\nThe entire west is lost up to the Mississippi River. The northern half is Russian and southern half is Chinese. The U.S. military overthrows the government in a junta, wiping out the wishy-washy politicians. D.C. is still the center of operations, but has been heavily fortified by the military and aid from the EU. \n\nRussia encroaches on Canadian territory in British Columbia, which jumps in England and most of the EU. The easternmost Soviet satellite countries join Russia's side, with the poorer Asian nations joining China, knowing that they will be next to be colonized if they don't accede early. Upcoming world powers like India and Brazil stay completely neutral, secretly vowing to side with whoever the winners are.\"",

It won't go well, whoever the incumbent is will lose an election over it, their successor will try to offload the war effort onto regional partners, and those nations will buckle under pressure. Piled on top of runaway climate change and stresses on Middle East oil exporters by increasing domestic production and green energy transitions, several governments collapse in a wave echoing the Arab Spring. \n\nSouth Asia is going to collapse horribly in thirty years at the latest. The precipitating factor in India's collapse will probably be some sort of intervention in Bangladesh to contain sectarian violence and a surge of climate migrants rather than a war with Pakistan, but that might also come toward the end. Prior to that time, India's turn toward authoritarianism and steadfast commitment to neutrality/unwillingness to subordinate its foreign policy to the \"rules-based international order\" will see them reframed as an adversary equal to China by Western media, and that will add stresses to Indian society by isolating it as the world bifurcates.\n\nBoth events will cool Cold War II as the US and China abandon attempts to lead the current world order and turn inward. Neither a \"good\" nor \"bad\" outcome, just an inevitable exhaustion. New generations raised in a much more austere environment won't see much use for it anyway, their world will appear much larger and these conflicts will be more distant to them as the Internet balkanizes, war efforts prove unsustainable, and culture in general turns away from a universalist, productivist mentality. That's sort of an optimistic scenario predicated on us producing some really miraculous tech in time (vat-grown meat, fusion power- unlikely since all the \"market solution\" hype is in spontaneously combusting EVs) and somehow producing it to scale with the precarious global supply chains gone by that point. But maybe it's possible. Otherwise, resource wars become nuclear wars.",

                "comment_body": "Im going to predict how Israel-Palestinian conflict will likely go.\n\nIn 20 years time, Israel will likely be facing severe sanctions for its occupation of the West Bank. Both from grassroots in Europe and America. Israel will likely end its occupation of the West Bank in response, because of three reasons. One, Israel likes its living standards. Two, Israel needs trade to maintain its technological edge and make sure its citizens live safely. Three, I suspect there will be a period of quiet for Israeli civilians after Oct 7th due to IDF basically reshaping itself and being ready for any attacks. This will make the Israeli public more open to a Palestinian state, after hostilities calm down for two decades.\n\nIsrael ends its occupation of the West Bank, not in least because it wants to remain a Jewish state. The Palestinian state becomes a basket case that fails, within a couple years. You get tens of thousands of rockets fired from the West Bank at Israeli population centers. Please note, with how the West Bank is positioned, almost all Israeli population centers are in range of large amounts of rockets.\n\nEventually, and probably when an economic recession happens, a Far Right figure like Ben Gvir, not Netanyahu, comes to power on the promise of expelling the Palestinians from the West Bank. Israel does so.\n\nThis starts a small regional war. Egypt will break its peace treaty with Israel, but as long as Israel doesnt expel the Gazans, it wont attack Israel for fear of nuclear response. Jordan will be forced to attack, as it is where the majority of Palestinians are expelled. Since Israel has a strong military with a lot of experience compared to Jordan military, which primarily for regime protection, the Israelis win.\n\nJordan likely faces collapse from something like 4 million Palestinian refugees from the West Bank overwhelming them. This leads to a collapse of the Jordanian state to some regard, but not entirely. More of just a break down in order.\n\nIsrael potentially faces American bombing for committing ethnic cleansing and invading a sovereign country. How intense is variable, also dependent is whether America would bomb civilian areas. Israel is highly urbanized, so any bombing run would kill a lot of civilians. I say potentially, because Im unsure if America would do so in face of potential nuclear response from Israel. But the Americans might think the Israelis arent suicidal enough to launch nukes, and thus go ahead with it. It largely does nothing but kill some people, and maybe get the Israelis to withdraw from Jordan. Not the West Bank or allow the Palestinians to get back.\n\nIsrael is now among the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world. It is poor as dirt, and has few trade partners if any. It does not face invasion, because it has nuclear weapons. Many Israelis are starving and hungry because of their dependency on food imports, meaning Israelis try to escape Israel. \n\nThis sends hordes of boat refugees from Israel to Europe. As Europe is dealing with climate migration already, and ever rising and more accepted far right, I think the countries in which Israelis land will be hostile to accepting them. This means Italy, Greece, France, and Southeastern Europe. Germany may make guarantees to have Israeli refugees come to there, but I think many southern European countries will be dissuaded from it.\n\nThis does not make Israel collapse. Israel is instead like Lebanon or North Korea. A poor country whose population faces hostile attacks, in a very dense area. Actually, the most likely comparison is Gaza. Short of an actual invasion, Israel does not collapse, much like Hamas rule in Gaza. It is very likely food aid is called for by European countries, to stop refugees from coming from Israel and to prevent mass starvation. \n\nIsrael likely expels its Arab citizen population among this. Israel basically becomes a state where its Jewish majority isnt threatened.\n\n50 years pass. Israeli Jews become sick of their standard of living and misery in their open air prison. Israel makes an agreement with Arab states and the rest of the world to normalize relations and trade, on agreement that the original refugees are allowed to return. Probably not their descendants, just the original refugees, because I suspect the Israelis will hold out on losing their Jewish majority state. Even if they dont, it doesnt matter. Palestinian refugees dont want to return. Most refugees will be dead by then, or live in much more hospitable places than Israel. Israel is a poor religious and somewhat miserable country to live in, so almost no one wants to move their compared to the better living standards of the rest of the world. It is also populated by religious militant Jews, who following Meir Kahane, all have a local supply of guns and ammunition to strong arm any Palestinian that shows up into leaving. Every Jew a .22 becomes a way to deny Palestinian refugees, even if the govt accepts. I would also note, the youngest refugees will be 50 by then. Most of the children will be in their 60s or 70s. \n\nIsrael will likely still have a population of around 6 million Jews at least, because of population growth of the Ultra Orthodox. A majority of Israeli Jews will live outside Israel, but Israel will remain a Jewish majority state.\n\n\nThat is a likely worst case scenario for the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It all changes if Russia becomes a major Israeli sponsor. Russia notably, does not care about optics and sponsors some of the worst regimes in the world. Many of Israels population are Russian and soviet Jews. There is a tendency among some of Putins circle, to be sympathetic to Israel as a Russian colony. So under the table Russia Israeli trade cant be discounted. Russia is currently ramping up its military production, is currently surviving and adapting to sanctions, and is disconnected from the Western SWIFT financial system. \n\nIsrael also being a major bastion of Western and American tech, cant be discounted. If the West sanctions Israel, Israelis intelligence on Western tech will likely fall into Russian hands. Israel supplied its Arrow 3 missile defense system to some countries in Europe, I believe Germany. You can bet Russian nationalists or a Putin successor would like that knowledge. Israel also has F35s, the main US fighter Jet until the 2070s. \n\nNote, I am not certain or even saying its likely Russia becomes a major sponsor of Israel. I just see it as a possibility. It is absolutely in Russias ability to play both Iran and Israel and be allies to both, and not give a shit if they fight or take pot shots at each other.\n\nI also think its probably Lebanon is sent into literal ruin when Israel expels the Palestinians, because Hezbollah or some other Lebanese militia will attack Israel. Im not sure if Israel will expel Lebanese civilians up to the Litani river, to have a buffer for the Galilee and North of Israel.\n\nIsrael can probably easily defeat Jordan, Lebanon and Syria in a war, even in 20 years. Its Egypt they probably cant, although Egypt probably wont want to if it doesnt attack the Sinai. The fear of nuclear response on Cairo, if it invades the internationally recognized borders of Israel, where there are populated areas, is strong.\n\nedit: I would also like to note. Israel will only expel the Palestinians, if they attack at large. If they dont, Israel doesnt.",

(marx thought that capitalism would end itself and lead to communism; adam smith thought it would lead to a stable state economy.)\n\nthe 22nd century will be very interesting. temperature and sea level will raise dramatically (not because we will keep polluting, but from all the CO2 that has been produced already) unless people find a way to sequester all the co2 that has already been put into the atmosphere. global temperatures might rise another four Celsius by the end of the 22nd century, and sea levels might see double digit increases as well. the task to revert this is titanic specially considering the amount of energy required to do so in quick fashion. some people estimate there are not enough material (mineral) resources to build a carbon-free energy infrastructure that can sustain current economic activity levels.\n\nthe population by the end of the 22nd century might be around 1 billion (down from 9 or 10 billion at its peak this century). not because of climate change or a diminution of earth's \"carrying capacity,\" but simply because the urban (aka \"developed\") way of living does not value societal reproduction processes (e.g. having children, case in point: south korea and all other developed economies). \n\nso, yes, life will go on. planet earth has two static equlibria: snowball earth and hothouse earth. we know this from the geological record. advanced human civilization has existed within a rare and brief dynamic equilibrium period. will a planet with fewer people and greater technological development become a more peaceful one? \n\nwill the efforts to secure *in perpetuity* future generations' right to exist be taken seriously and become a post-growth civilization's new purpose? \n\nor will the never ending growth program of capitalism continue being carried on by machines (physical and abstract) in a post-human economy?",

Water scarcity can be incrementally addressed (not all at once, or for free, or by magic) with controlled environment agriculture, cultured meat and the rest of cellular agriculture is still improving, etc.  Solar Foods and Air Protein, using hydrogenotrophs to make analogues of flour and plant oils, are building factories now.  Deep Branch is already using hydrogenotrophs to make feed for aquaculture and chickens, with no arable land needed.  \n\nOn top of which most water use is to feed animals we eat, plus dairy.  Tax or regulate water going to animal feed, i.e. make meat more expensive, and that can partly be addressed by people eating more plants.   And desalination continues to get cheaper.   Water is not an insurmountable problem, so you'd have to assume that countries are utterly incapable to taking any measures to reduce water use.   Even just using normal greenhouses can reduce water use by 90% in some cases.  \n\nOn emissions, they're expected to plateau globally before long, then start to decline.  They won't plummet, but they will improve.  Technology can (not by magic, not all at once, not for free) shift us to better sources of energy.  There's even e-fuel for long-term storage, aviation, and marine applications.   None of this means success is guaranteed, but neither is failure.

This is due to the increased militarization of space.

The need to develop a delivery system while keeping a \"peaceful\" facade of exploration, curiosity, and scientific endeavor have led us to the next logical conclusion= nuclear weapons aren't necessary if you have the capacity to throw a cheap rock accurately at a target. The end result is still the same if planned properly. Megatons of force for a fraction of the financial and natural resource costs, potentially even a fraction of the labor costs even if it calls for highly skilled labor the rate of technological progress has begun to facilitate even advanced rocket science.\n\nWhen a massive object impacts the earth the radioisotopes have a relatively short and safe half-life that allows for that area to very quickly be taken by ground forces. A nuke isn't as clean or as easy to plan to deploy in plain sight.\n\nI doubt nuclear weapons will ever be used on Earth again unless a global power wants to look weak and unable to refrain from a petty \"scorched Earth\" strategy.

I don't think they will ever invade Taiwan now that the west is doing everything they can to try and stop it.  However if the US becomes significantly more isolationist then maybe they do invade Taiwan.  If they ever get Taiwan then they can start to project global military power, especially in the absence of the US doing that.   I really think the US got to the point to where it is through geographical advantages and making powerful alliances.  Hopefully we strengthen our ties with the EU and pacific nations over the next 75 years because we are more powerful together and democracies are great.\n\nNo idea what will happen with these demographic collapses.  I do think (as strange as this will sound) that the US is much more prepared at accepting other cultures and different people who immigrate here and our mix of cultures we already have should be an advantage in the long run if we manage to stop polarizing everything.\n\nI also think dictatorships are more prone to failure and corruption than a democracy.  They can make changes quickly, but much like when you have a boss that micromanages everything, they tend to fail because it all depends on one person and the people that are promoted are people pleasers.  Luckily in America we built a system that works rather than depending on a single person, but that system is being stressed like never before.",

This was the typical folly of futurology, where trends from the 20th century were simply assumed to  continue indefinitely. \n\nRight now the population of the entire world except Subsaharan Africa (and very few exceptions outside it) is rapidly approaching the fertility of below 2.0. It seems to be a cultural thing more than economic (seeing how even hyper welfare Nordic states have this problem): people just don't want to have many children in the modern civilization's framework. We are going to hit the global population plateau at some point in the 21st century, and it's going to be prolonged almost entirely by Africa. And then - decline.\n\nAnd yet, sci fi tends to expect human population continuously increasing by billions in the future, and said billions colonizing countless planets. But what if the future is simply not going to involve significant population growth? In the long term right now we are threatened by the population \\*decline\\*! \n\nIf you send 10,000 space colonists and they have our modern cultural makeup, then they naturally die out with the fertility <2.0, or increase extremely slowly across centuries with fertility of idk 2.5. African countries in the 20th century had the insane fertility up to 7.0 children per pcouple (unimaginable for us today), and yet they increased their pop \"only\" tenfold across the century. \n\nWe won't have many people in the future to colonize space, unless our culture either becomes extremely pro-natalist (go on, have 6 children with your spouse, say bye bye to hedonism and hobbies) or just produces clones en masse (ethically dubious).",

A person with kids isn't gonna leave your country and a person without is a massive good riddance. \n\n>We are going to hit the global population plateau at some point in the 21st century\n\nThe scarier thing, the thing that really should keep you up at night is we're well well into the peak of birthrates amongst the educated. \n\nThe supply of high end engineers/scientists is evaporating. We're gonna see some real real societal issues if we have a ever shrinking pool of skilled individuals. \n\nRussia is already seeing a huge decline in its high end talent and it's part of why the war happened. \n\nItaly once had a very high catholic birthrate while being one of the most established advanced societies in the world. They were one of the main immigrant groups of the 20th century. That type of migration is over. \n\nThere's no advanced societies that still have high birthrates. 100% of what is left is almost exclusively countries that barely have running water, sanitation and electricity. \n\nWe're gonna hit the educated abyss circa 2030. The collective demand for immigrants in the developed countries will be in excess of 100 million per decade. There just isn't that many educated people in Africa. Africa's human development index is incredibly low. \n\nThe odds we're gonna have immigrants coming to Europe making enough income to pay taxes necessarily to fund someone elses pension is incredibly unlikely. If you only consider the income of your average african and assume they'll perform like an average chinese immigrant based on incomes of their hosts nations you're missing the boat. \n\nWe're probably already are at the point where countries like Germany are taking in immigrants that'll make the problem worst rather than better. \n\nWe need to get birth rates up, the educated demographic timebomb is far worst than the global issue. \n\n> unless our culture either becomes extremely pro-natalist (go on, have 6 children with your spouse, say bye bye to hedonism and hobbies)\n\nIf people label the discussion of pro natalism as a topic extreme you're gonna have that problem. So far most pronatalist attitudes have come from authoritarian sources. \n\nWe don't need women popping out 9 at a time. 3 per family would just be fine. We all know families where they have 3 kids. It's not because they've achieved reproductive godhood status. \n\n> people just don't want to have many children in the modern civilization's framework\n\nRight it's a motivation issue not an issue of desire. Our entire society has been designed around low birth rates, we have no idea what a higher birth rate culture even looks like. \n\n>If you send 10,000 space colonists and they have our modern cultural makeup, then they naturally die out with the fertility <2.0, or increase extremely slowly across centuries with fertility of idk 2.5\n\n2.5 isn't slow, that's the whole point, 2.5 is in the territory of very scary overpopulation bomb. If we had 2.5 now, you'd have 8 trillion people by the year 2800. Exponentials build up quickly. \n\n Just the same 1.5 means we'll go virtually extinct by 3600. \n\nThe point is we'll have to find a solution there's no way around it. It's a survival of the species issue and the more we decline the harder it'll be to pull out of it. \n\nWe're at a now or never point. We need to get past 2.1 this decade or the next. Otherwise we might face a societal collapse.  \n\n\n\n> or just produces clones en masse (ethically dubious).\n\nIf life extension becomes normalized it's very probable that we'll have a baby boom as people in their 50s and 60s will be having more children. I.e. have 2.2 or more children over a 200 year life span.",

The two hadn't fought since the War of 1812, and relations during the 19th century were largely lukewarm due to relative U.S. isolationism and British interests elsewhere in the world. There were sometimes fights (largely political and diplomatic) over conflicting interests in the Americas, but these were mild tensions at best. Despite the growing political power of anti-British Irish-Americans, relations between the U.S. and Britain never really deteriorated.\n\nThe actual Great Rapprochement was due to, in addition to Germany's naval arms race with Britain, cooperation on interests in the Far East (particularly in China) and British withdrawal in large part from North America. Without conflicting interests in North America, they were free to support each other; Washington quietly backed Britain in the Boer War by not supporting the more popular Boers, and Britain backed Washington in the Spanish-American War. \n\nThe rapprochement was not actually a done deal even into the 20th century. In the Venezuelan crisis of 1902-1903, Britain backed Germany over the U.S. and Venezuela, but that was the last time in the prewar period that Britain supported Germany in a major international event. Anglo-German cooperation during that crisis came about as a result of mutual financial interests in Venezuela, so it was not a foregone conclusion at the time that the U.S.-Britain relationship would only continue to strengthen and that Britain-Germany relations would deteriorate so badly as to help lead to a major conflict.",

                "comment_body": "> I've looked at your other comments\n\nBelieve it or not I've been researching the topic for 20 years and it let me down my path of education. \n\nYou're make the low bar move of assuming I've never researched the topic. I'm a physics nerd, I literally dream myself to sleep thinking about terraforming mars and the likes. \n\nClimate science is handcuffed by fluid flow/ ocean currents, wind and moisture going from land to air. \n\nTo model fluid flow you throw magic pixie dust in the air or you acknowledge 1st year physics where it simple cannot be done, again you can't even simulate the fluid flow of a flushing toilet. That's water at one set temperature in one easy to define toillette bowl shape, in a brief second. \n\nGlobal fluid flows are the literal definition of \"infinitely more complex\" virtually impossible to model from a data science perspective. \n\nScientists know this, they cannot predict what will happen or produce reliable data of what will happen, so they use data from past to make a blind guess about the future. \n\nMeanwhile these scientists or at least the ones who know what they are talking about, understand we're about to transition into a total paradigm shift, where the worlds oceans wil reverse directions, radically change pressures/temperatures etc. \n\nThere's no credible scientist who's gonna claim any data beyond that paradigm shift. \n\nSo what the scientific community has conspired to do, is downplay their lack of knowledge. They can't be \"we have no idea what will happen, most of the research we are doing won't be relavent under a paradigm shift, otherwise we don't get paid\". They rewrote the narrative, they aren't trying to find unknowable data, they're \"trying to build consensus\" which is why they are obsessed on the numbers counts for home many scientists agree with the premise. \n\nI know it's hard to believe that climate change is full of bias from scientists but that is just the fact of life. Peer review isn't the magic you think it is, the scientific community isn't objective. \n\nAll this talk of reducing emissions is categorically a political agenda. There's no way to do a substantially reduction sans reducing coal usage. \n\nThe only way of reducing carbon output on a meaningful scale is a build up of nuclear, and a radical reduction is personal consumption, which will never happen unless you have a socialist dictator like Stalin or Mao in power. \n\nThere are a handful of credible people like Greta Thorenberg who won't drive and focus on having a low carbon footprint, but she's a rare bird. \n\nThe vast majority of climate scientists own cars/detached homes etc and live ultra carbon intense lifestyles. If you look up your consumer data, the kind of educated more left leaning professionals i.e. scientists have categorically upgraded from small cars to midsized SUV's since global warming has gone mainstream. I'm literally 500 meters away from a climate research institution, there's cars aren't concealed under some stealth technology. \n\nIf rich well educated scientists won't do a carbon downgrade you'll never get mainstream support for a serious globalized drop in consumption. \n\nI'm not just talking about the fuel in your car, all the aluminums/metals in your cars have too be extracted from the earth's surface it's incredibly energy intensive and cannot be done using electric powered cars(you need massive dump trucks for examples). The creation of rubber tires/ashpault for your roads need massive amounts of omissions. In addition to all that you buy into a carbon intense lifestyle, with a detached home/parking lots etc. \n\nI get you're young I gave up on a carbon rich lifestyle in 2006 and nothing has changed sans working from home(with many of these people still owning cars), despite us living in a digitized lifestyle. \n\nDriving less or any of these schemes are junk science, you can't live a carbon intense lifestyle and think you have a chance of dropping emissions. \n\nSolar and Wind are environmental frauds as they actually in some cases cause a larger carbon footprint as you need to supplement unreliable energy with something like coal, or even worst building excess capacity in your industry to make up for consistent and unpredictable down times. \n\nWhen you have unreliable energy you don't just build a 20% bigger factory because you're down 20% of the time. It's more like twice the size because you then need to build in buffer spaces in your production and doing things like building larger warehouses/required longer supply chains which means more travel to make goods. \n\nThe only solution to climate change, as a large portion of the damage has already been done is heavy industry. \n\nCarbon capture, making so the earth collects less heat from the sun i.e. putting relfectors at Lagrange point 2 between earth sun. \n\nEverything else is just wishful thinking. \n\nIn addition to all of this you need to be able to build aqueducts and other moisture controlling systems to prevent desertification.",

If I was China, I would do everything I could to secure the vacuum left behind from a collapsing Russia, because it is only through Russia that china can secure true energy independence. The US could deprive them of access to any other energy source fairly easily. India also has this problem. To be honest, there isn’t another country on earth that has close to the natural advantages that the US enjoys. Arable land, space to grow into (low population density), ample energy resources, access to both the pacific and Atlantic, geographical barriers to invasion on all sides, the cultural superpower of being able to mint new Americans at will through immigration, the most robust modern military tradition, strong coalition of industrialized allies … the best bet another nation has is to wait until demographic decay comparatively weakens the US coalition, then make a series of moves to slowly chip away at the US’s advantages.

Strangely enough, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and their bringing these ideas and questions more mainstream, will likely have the opposite effect than Putin intended.  The US was in cruise control prior to the war, and after the Trump isolationist era, and wasn’t asking these strategic questions of themselves.  The war will set Russia back more than 20 years, and likely bring India forward by about the same while China does the authoritarian plateau.  The US is awake again, and will use their time more wisely to develop relationships around to world, and make moves that enrich their allies and ensure their standing in the world order.\n\nThe US will not be beat through war.  The US also isn’t seeking a “unipolar” world like some would have us believe.  What Putin or Xi doesn’t seem to get, is that the international community doesn’t want a dictator and hardliner at the top, because nothing good will come of it for anyone.  Law and order, and someone or body to enforce it, who’s going to try and be fair and unbiased, and not oppressive, is necessary for not only peace, but for economies and trade, and the many facets of everyday life that affects.

In fact, we will cease to be the most powerful state within a decade.\n\nMost people haven’t noticed but the world has already transitioning from a unipolar world order (led by us) until a decade ago, to a multi-polar world order. There currently are these 4 poles in the order of geo-political strength: US, China, India, & Russia.\n\nOur hegemony was based on 2 things from WW2 to 1970s which were superior military (since we were unharmed by both WW1 and WW2) and relative financial might (since the rich fled from UK and Europe before WW1 into US and brought with them their money). After 1970, we replaced our organic financial superiority with forced USD hegemony (on account of it becoming fiat while being the world currency). \n\nHowever, now we’ve sort of lost the military edge since:1) the other 3 polar powers are also nuclear-capable, and 2) we cannot sustain our defense expenditure since for the first time I our history our defense expenses have crossed the total interest we pay on our debt. And since the internet will continue to increase, we will need to cut defense expenses. \n\nNow with countries deliberately getting out of USD trades, we are losing out on the USD hegemony. This is notable from the drop in USD’s share in global reserve from 60% before Ukraine war to 46% right now.",

The last 2 or 3 years have shown that neither China nor Russia have what it takes to supplant America as the world's superpower. After the trailing effects of Covid and the War in Ukraine have petered out, I expect a continuation of the global reset to the West. This should positively effect the other bulwarks of the liberal-democratic order like Germany, France, Japan, and the UK (if the UK can figure out how to get competent leaders in charge).\n\nHaving America take the lead tends to benefit so many other states that it's really in most everyone's self-interest to keep it this way. For instance, the US military keeps lanes of travel for people and goods safe and free. It doesn't cost a thing and it keeps the world economy moving along smoothly. No one else will do that.\n\nBarring some unforseen cataclysmic event, the US will remain the major global power throughout our lifetimes.",

That would require more than 1 nation to challenge US supremacy and no matter how big a game Putin talks, Russia isn’t doing that. Neither is India, Brazil, South Africa, or any of the BRICS countries outside of China.\n\nChina is the only game in town. If I am wrong, and in 20 years the US is not the world’s only hegemony, it will be because China has forced a Bipolar world order, not a multipolar one.",

Remove China from the middle income countries and you will see the same since the mid 2010s.  \nSo the two drivers of the decline of the West relative to the rest of the world are China's performance and higher population growth in the rest of the world. Both of those factors are slowing down.  \nChina faces alot of problems like bad demographics, an overreliance on investment and a increaslingly hostile West that will slow down its growth significantly and might result in stagnation.  \nBirthrates outside the West are crashing and since the West receives alot of immigration from other countries its population growth will probably equal the rest of the world in 20 to 30 years.  \nThe gap in gdp per capita will probably increase in the future for a variety of reasons. Alot of developing countries face debt crises that will slow down growth for years if not decades, automation and AI will mainly profit the West and China whilst mainly removing jobs in developing countries, rising protectionism in the West will hurt developing countries, western dominance of capital and brain drain will move promising businessses to the West and climate change will hurt developing countries much more than the West.  \nOverall I think that in 50 years the West will be much stronger relative to the rest of the world than it is right now.",

Things like GDP per Capita aren't truly representative by the way - otherwise everyone would want to live in Qatar for example.\n\nMy point is, even if America might have fertile resources like a lot of people are suggesting (something I find debatable actually, but am not interested in discussing more since I think the point I am making is more important), if it doesn't have the 'visuals' to sell it's greatness, it's perception as a hegemon or whatever will surely decline regardless.

While nominal has its place in imports/exports, the influx of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) , Stock Market cap and size of consumer market for company investments, these numbers alone does not make you powerful than someone with higher GDP PPP. Adjusted for PPP, China's military budget is much higher and they can produce more technical innovation with less money. So US nominal GDP looks bigger but the cost is much higher too, so the affordability or purchasing power is relatively lower -- basically we are an expensive economy as expected. Also, China would have achieved parity with US military by 2050.\n\nAlso, India's GDP PPP will be higher than US by 2050, currently India's GDP PPP is 50% that of US and is growing at much faster pace.

US had its own Industrial Revolution, like UK. It also had a strong push for scientific discoveries like EU. \n2. Unlike UK, US’s colonies were limited.\n3. US had a larger population than UK and its mainland never had to face any devastation. So Industries and transportation could continue to grow for multiple decades (outside of economic limitations)\n4. Post WW1, EU was in shambles. US’s economy was doing fine. (until great depression)\n5. A similar thing happened in WW2, the US’s next would economic/military rival was defeated before they had lasting effect in world politics.\n6. Post WW2, Japan started doing what IS had pre WW1. Its industrialization and scientific research output was increasing. But it lacked the backing of population the size of US.\n7. Now, most of US manufacturing has moved out. It’s nowhere near as UK. US now focuses on high-value production for most part.\n\nChina is now in a position where it has industries and a large population to support it. Domestic market growth is really important to shield yourself from external economic factors (as these are the real threats for powerful countries). \n\nSo yes based on these reasons, other countries can and will become significant on world stage to weaken or even prevent US hegemony. The time-frame maybe longer depending on situations in these countries tries too. I think, the world will most likely move towards a multipolar order when US hegemony isn’t strong.

Us is actually by far the more underestimated in these projections. \n\nMeanwhile their 2025 projection for India in 2009 was over 10.7 trillion but in reality only 3.176 trillion in 2021…\n\nEven China they had at projected at 25.5 trillion 2025 but actually well behind at only 17.76 trillion in 2021.\n\nIndonesia and Nigeria? Both their 2021 gdp is half what 2009 pwc projected it to be in 2025.\n\nThese projections about the rise of the rest are hyper idealistic and frankly disproven. I also worked in the investment field and put these sorts of 20 year projections for individual companies which should be much easier with fewer variables. I know from experience these projections are pretty worthless anywhere past the 3 or 5 year mark.\n\nMeanwhile most western countries have actually almost matched or exceeded the projections. There are few other candidates to really to up end the balance all that much.\n\nReality is the longterm demographics favor the us and Europe. US population is projected to only rise continuously through 2100; Europe also has room for similar growth.

But in reality it is a passing fad that will have some effect worthy of mention in the history books, but will ultimately prove to NOT be a formative occurrence in American history.\n\nWe are approaching a world where labor in the West will be in shortage, and policies and social movements that push away ANYONE will need to die for economic reasons. If there’s one thing you can count on in the US, is economy > everything else. Business interests clamouring for labor will put anyone standing in their way into the ground (metaphorically for the most part, but also literally if they have to).\n\nThe US has been here before; a push towards isolationism, a push against immigration. It died the several times it occurred to economic interests, and those interests are as powerful now as they were in those times. \n\nIf you are one of the people caught up in this wave of hate and marginalization, it really doesn’t feel like a fad at all. If it goes on for 20-30 years and affects you greatly, how can it only be a fad? Well… just look at how little affect Islamic extremism has on American politics now. Back in 2005 it felt like it dominated everything: American soil attacked, trillion dollar wars, constant battles in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dominated the news. Now we fast-forward 15-20 years, Islamic extremism hasn’t been defeated, it still exists and it still has teeth… but it just isn’t a factor in American politics, didn’t affect American geopolitics all that much and looking back it was just a side activity in the American machine. It’ll be a minor footnote in the history books 50 years from now. \n\nHow did it change from dominating everything to gone in a decade or two? Well… its because it didn’t really dominate anything, it just seemed like it; especially if you lost someone in 9/11, or if you lived in the Middle East or fought in Iraq/Afghanistan. But geopolitically for America it was a notable but still minor thing. The economy still grew like crazy, economic goals and realities took priority over it (and everything else), even if the news didn’t make it seem like it. Adversaries like China and Russia still dominated geopolitical decision making.\n\nAn isolationist and fear mongering President will seem like a drastic change in direction for America, and living through it will definitely feel that way. But like previous things that will ‘change America forever’… it really won’t. Not in the ways that matter. His biggest threat is ultimately to individual freedoms, and sadly, Americans have far less of those than they realize… but those too ebb and flow. And they don’t affect geopolitical power all that much anyway.",

The US critique of Russia is that even if Crimea/the Donbass are pro-Russia you have to respect Ukranian sovereignty, whereas with China it's in supporting Taiwanese self-determination while still recognising Taiwan as de jure a part of China.",

Yes, some of our manufacturing is returning home, which is good, however there will still be some in India, China, and SE Asia. \nIsolation is is only likely to occur if a Republican is elected who looks to appease Russia or China in order to line his pockets or the pockets of corporations who benefit from Russia meddling in our elections in order to help elect more Republicans whom support tax cuts for corporations. \nI think a war over Taiwan can still happen. I think reduced trade between China and the USA during a war causing inflation is the biggest risk for the USA during a war over Taiwan. With Taiwan being heavily armed hopefully with asymmetric weapons such as NLAWs, Stingers, and shoulder fired anti ship harpoon missiles, I think help from the USA and our Allies will be more than enough to cripple China’s military. \nChina can’t match the F-35 and as such they have little chance of stopping the USA from inflicting large damage on them as they attempt to invade Taiwan.",

Manufacturing by TSMC in Taiwan is being shifted more and more to being done in the USA. Micron also just announced a gigantic factory for New York State. Biden’s chips and science act is spurring a big resurgence. \n\nAfrica is set to be hit hard by climate change and is still very unstable politically in addition to dealing with problems from European assisted overthrows or installations. \n\nAI and robotics are set to accelerate growth exponentially, not linearly, much like the extraction of oil did for the West starting in the late 1800s. Just like oil did for the West back then, the difference between the West and the rest widened instead of closed. I believe that is likely to happen again with the advent of AI. \nThe rest of the world simply doesn’t have the money to innovate like the West does.

                "comment_body": "> which rules in particular they are\n\nYou have to understand the historical context first: for the overwhelming majority of human history, countries fought for resources rather than shared them. It happens today too, but nowhere near the same level. \n\nFor example, the great powers of Europe were constantly at war with each other to protect their colonies, which was a system so destructive and wasteful, pretty everything colonizers extracted and stole from their colonies was used to fund these wars. Take any book to describe how much European stole from natives and then use this knowledge understand all this money was wasted in wars. It culminated in World World I and II, which were the worst wars in human history.\n\nBut European colonization era was just a time in history where Europe had power over the world. Before European powers, local empires acted this way, this was the normal everywhere. The world ran on extractive political institutions, so now the goal is creating and maintaining inclusive political institutions. \n\nThis is achieved through:\n\n* sufficiently centralized and organized authority that can maintain order, uphold laws, and prevent local strongmen or warlords from exerting undue influence — which is the reason why countries rich in natural resources today are poor, corruption/warlords/cartels/organized crime constantly funnel away money that belongs to the people\n* distribution of power so power is not concentrated in the hands of a few — basically the real reason why the rule-based world order is opposed; nationalism is the tool for the upper elite to manipulate the masses into keeping power for themselves, and pointing at outside forces is their main way to shift blame when the effects of these policies are felt by the general population. \n* allowing citizens to participate in the political process and ensuring everybody has access to the infrastructure to participate in political decision-making process, it should not be a challenge to make your voice heard\n\nIt is also not something that is done once, but it’s on-going process, with many examples of stumbling, and all those stumbles appear as hypocrisy to other nations. It is extremely difficult to maintain as there are always internal forces seeking to destroy it. Majority of money is not physical, it is constantly being created through work, so if it’s not reaching the people today, it’s not because of an event 30 years ago, that event 30 years ago was a stumble. It’s because there are forces right now that working to stop it to reach people, and usually these forces are known as corruption. \n\n> how the dozen or so countries the USA invaded since WWII fit into them\n\nThey are the exception to the fact [we live in the most peaceful time in history](https://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-events/most-peaceful-time-in-history.htm). What used to be the normal all over the world, has now become a point of criticism, because standards have increased.\n\n> respect Ukrainian sovereignty\n\nThey are saying “do not invade Ukraine.”\n\n> whereas with China\n\nThey are saying “do not invade Taiwan.” \n\nThat’s pretty consistent.",

Many of these businesses don't make much, and they also rely on extensive unpaid family labor to help get by. This is also something that many immigrants have access to as immigrants continue to have higher birthrates than native born citizens. \n\nThere are plenty of immigrants who don't go this route, one good example are tech workers and doctors. These professional are so in demand that things like cultural differences, minor language issues, and a lack of a network can be ignored.

The East had dictators who forced slavery of rice cultivation and then stole all of the product. They also didn’t allow education. \n\nYou think the rest of the world has caught up? Why? Because China finally built skyscrapers that have been in Thailand or Taiwan for over 30 years? America invented skyscrapers over a century ago. China has been able to build them after the technology and know how has been mastered by the rest of the globe. In other words, they haven’t had to spend on R&D like America did. \n\nIn what way has China caught up to the West? Russia was closer to the West 50 years ago, but has only fallen drastically further behind since then. \n\nRussian weapons and technology have been shown to be inept and very far behind the West. The Chinese Covid vaccine is far inferior to the West. Chinese semiconductors and AI are far inferior to the West. Even building vehicles, China had to steal the technology from Germany in order to be able to manufacture their own. \n\nChina offers lax labor and environmental regulations in addition to cheap labor and they therefore are able to manufacture relatively non complex products. \n\nChina is the size it is because over half of the country is colonies that they seized. Mongolia colonized most of Asia. Where are they now? Japan colonized much of Asia during WWII and during the decades preceding it. Where is Japan now? \n\nI’m not sure if it was you mentioning South America and Africa, but I think so. Yes Africa and South America will advance in terms of basic development, but there is not one country in either continent that has the money nor population to create it that leads to an ability to compete with the West in high tech, especially when the West is starting with a gigantic monetary and technological lead.\n\nEven if some of these countries advance, they won’t be close to us in technology, so of what consequence is their advancement? What defines a “sphere or bloc” other than its ability to compete or be relevant? Their will be countries with advanced infrastructure and education, but how does this create a bloc that threatens the West? And if this bloc can’t threaten or compete with the West, of what consequence is the bloc? Do you honestly think that India whim is 40 years behind the West in chips, is somehow going to make up 40 years in the next 30 years all whilst the USA is still marching forward in the sector? India is going to make up 70 years of difference in the next 30 years competing with the most innovative country on the planet? I don’t think so. \n\nThe world and technology works much differently than it has ever before and from when other hegemony fell. \n\nThe USA can come apart from within, but I challenge you to say from whom and how it comes apart from the outside. \n\nI’m delusional? Which country do you expect to overtake the West?",

No country without a gigantic workforce stands a chance. India is the only country with a gigantic workforce, but unfortunately for them I believe they’re too late as AI and robotics will negate the power of a gigantic workforce. \n\nWhat sort of bloc would be created? China and Russia is the only viable powerful bloc and both are headed downhill. Russia is going to be near irrelevant outside of their nukes here pretty soon. \n\nIndia and China hate each other. The moment China forged closer ties with Southeast Asia, their only viable option for more power, is the moment India moves closer to the West in order to help themselves counter China. I also don’t see China forming any sort of bloc with SE Asia as most of SE Asia hated China more than they dislike the West and they’re also scared of China as China has gotten aggressive with them in the South China Sea.",

It threatens their profits and the power of the oil rich nations.\n\nYes. Waste is and has been a challenge with first generation storage. This is far from an insurmountable problem as many Countries now insist on improved design to enhance the ease and efficiency of reclaiming key materials from spent batteries and preventing toxic materials from polluting soils and water. Anyone that believes the waste from batteries is in any way comparable to the environmental harm from fossil fuels is smoking far too many conspiracies that they have been spoon fed, through social media, by Russian, Chinese and middle eastern State and Corporate actors intent on preserving their fossil fuel derived wealth, influence and geopolitical power.",

It would be an improvement for the world and frankly the US as the burden of supporting the world's poorest, becomes a more shared plan.\n\nYour point about institutions outlasting trump is weak. What institution is currently untouched from his corruption? And look at project 2025, it's literally an authoritative doctrine that will see the massive and deliberate undermining of America's 200+ years of consistent foreign and domestic policy and trends. \n\nTrump would blow past multipolarity, and move us into strengthening our adversaries while at the same time weakening the US ability to project and flex power around the world.\n\nHe diminishes it. \n\nTo go further. He not only diminishes American hegemony, but he diminishes western hegemony, which, if you live in a democracy in any part of the world, that's a bad thing for you. Because trump is a shift to fascism, and to have the most powerful country on earth shoot themselves in the foot, again, by electing trump will signal that not only are china and Russia, viable alternatives in the short term, china is the strong long term bet even over America as they will are positioned the best, to fill the power vacuum that a trump presidency would create.\n\nGo read the wiki for \"foundations of geopolitics\" by alexandr drugin. This is the goal of post Soviet Russia, to create a multipolar world similar to the cold war, but one that sees American culture diminished in the eyes of the world rather than admired. Russia has been involved with trump for years and the scandals in his presidency involving Russia(leaving Russian assets alone in the oval office, having a closed door one on one meeting with Putin unrecorded, praising Putin endlessly for his iron grip on Russia) show that Russia is intentional about their praise and proximity to trump. And that should concern people. Leave out trump for a moment and think about that. Russia, our adversary and nemesis, has sought to back trump wherever possible, and polls better with Republicans than centrist Joe Biden.\n\nIt's ridiculous to think that trump has no ill intentions of ilhe becomes president. He's online saying he wants milley to be killed and will certainly work towards retribution against anyone and everyone who didn't openly and loudly support him.",

As soon as the war ends the economy will drasticly retract.\n\nAnd not to forget most of the sanctions will only show themself in the medium term (I think even putin admitet it in a speech that russia will feel the sanctions in a medium term). A good example is aeroflot. At the moment they can still operate by cannabilizing planes for parts and just generaly lowering safty standards a lot. But at some point they wont be able to compensate until they get western spare parts again.\n\nAnd it is a problem for the whole industry. Industries are super reliant on special machines and what not. And most of them come from the west. At some point they will break and then russia wont have a way to repair/replace it. A good example is gazprom and how they couldnt repair some pumps themself and send them to canada (before the war) only to not get them back from canada because of the sanctions.\n\nAnd then you have stuff like brain drain, even shittier demographic prospect, heavier reliance on china that china will never lever against russia, drastic decrease in weapons export because who will buy them if they have seen them in action, political instability with dozens of PMCs (even Gazprom is now joining the fray) and other fun stuff to look forward to in the medium term.\n\nMeanwhile I live in the west, we use gas for heating, gas that came from russia before the war and now we get it mostly from norway and the netherlands. Except some increased prices there is not really any diffrence in my daily life compared to before the war. And while a lot of people I know allways complain about anything and tell you how bad everything is going, I know that they are not much more worse of then before the war. They basicly only complain about first-world-problems.",

His charisma is not going away. If you want to get into multipolarity, its an interesting thought exercise to me. It could be good for a time if the EU beefed up, or lead to where you have lots of military power focused around hurt ego countries. Either way it'd be hard to make them budge on the issue due to how much they love their social programs. \n\n\n2. You miss read institutions. Trump is a dunce on his own and didn't have the experience to pull the levers of government. His cabinet, supreme court picks, etc were all chosen either by old guard conservative groups that have been around for decades to even centuries or his cronies. Only thing him not getting in changes is P. 2025 becoming P. 2029. It sucks that progressives aren't as good at long term planning, but that is the benefit of being able to draw experience from groups like churches. \n\n\n3. Trump in this regard has only blown up what the public has been saying for years and what presidents have been pushing for. Prior to him we had been trying to get the EU nations to contribute their pledge amount to NATO and not posture themselves to be dependent on Russian oil. Liberals wanted to be done with all the ME wars and were pissed when Obama didn't call it quits. Isolation has a long history in this country and 45 making it public just made the low effort opinions louder.\n\n\n4. Why do you keep thinking Trump is some lone figure? Do you really think if he drops dead or gets locked up we won't see other members of the GOP trying to \"do what he would have wanted\"? The base is mad at dysfunctional government and populist reactions are what you get. And to add, Trump isn't even the only western fascist that has been gaining traction. French has had some close calls, Poland  is in the tank, and other countries the movements are getting grips of power. \n\n\n5. Good for Putin. I don't need a book on SR tactics to tell me the obvious that an opposing government preys on our fruit fly attention span. Heck any gov worth its salt is going to have administrations it prefers.\n\n\n6. I don't know where you are getting this. From me there is no love of Trump. The man is self centered and puts American citizen lives in danger without giving a damn. Our disagreement is that he is the cause of all the problems and it will go away once he loses 24. The reality is that he is just the loud mouth voicing the plan, disrupting the neo cons, and really the final form of the tea/freedom parties. \n\n\nBonus question: why is Joe considered a centralist to you? He has been pretty pro progressive as far as the law will allow him in his agenda. He understands he can't get everything he wants. But I cannot think of him throwing the right steaks that would land him centralist. Its a stark contrast to Trump who was extreme and crashed it all when he didn't get his way or even the GOP couldn't take it.",

This will cause supply shortage and inflation for the whole world, but it will hit the West a bit harder. \n\nTSMC has already built a factory in Arizona and is starting another. They’re also starting a factory in Germany as we speak. \n\nAnd come back to reality about what Ryaan? You think that attempting the largest amphibious landing in world history during a period of satellite intelligence that will make it obvious beforehand is the norm and my idea that it can be stopped is detached from reality? Think again. Really think this time. \n\nAnd really? Bringing up Vietnam? What does a full scale land invasion 50 years ago have to do with a modern altercation that will be fought from 2,000 miles away off the tarmac of carriers by planes loaded with 2,000+ mile range stand off weapons? More relevant would be the USA’s outstanding island hopping and naval dominance against Japan in WWII. This is after Pearl Harbor sank or damaged much of our Pacific fleet and after our navy was split between the Atlantic and Pacific. \n\nThe only units that will come close to Chinese units are stealthed and won’t ever be seen. The F-35, RQ-180 spy plane, Virginia class subs, and the USS Zumwalt. China’s units will be taken out by networked fourth generation aircraft circling 2,000 miles away with stand off weapons after acquiring target location from the F-35 and RQ-180. \n\nThe USA won’t be landing masses of troops in enemy territory.

Why, in their future product plans, do they incorporate a highly likely strategy of shift to tsmc's node, if they are already better? (Dont say due to production/manufacturing reasons; intel's been selling worldwide with chips coming from their own fabs). The latest apple A17 pro is also tsmc 3nm btw.\n\nBut yes, China most likely won't attack Taiwan, tho saying 'never' would be wishful thinking. Also I refer to Nam to remind you that even the worlds most advanced military, with all the money, technology, tactics & time at their disposal, faced defeat from a much weaker foe.\nYou're facing someone who won't just sit around while your machines do their thing. Besides, they just need to capture the shores, where tsmc has most of their prime fabs. If they have the tech, they wont care if their invasion was a success or repelled, they've already won. The world loses precious tech, while they (china) gain a massive superiority in the same. US wont go to war with China over this.",

Do you understand how incredibly difficult that is?

An amphibious invasion of this complexity has never been competed before. D-Day was hidden from view. The USA will know about this invasion for weeks whilst China is building up for it. The invasion has to occur in a small specific area that will be bombarded with missiles from Taiwan and the USA. \n\nFinally, Vietnam never won. The USA never lost, we simply just didn’t win. The death ratio on Vietnam’s side was tremendous. Furthermore, as I said this war will be fought as unit versus unit not human versus human. There also won’t be any land invasion nor any country takeover. Planes will be fighting planes and ships on ships. \n\nThe USA will most certainly go to war with China over this especially considering that China is likely to launch ballistic missiles at Okinawa and Guam in the opening moments of the battle.",

It doesn't have the population to support the level of innovation required for the growth of the dominant sectors. \n\nWhat it *can* be though, is a significant soft power state. Higher focus on cultural exports and financial services would be key. We've seen a slight resurgence of British film and TV occupying a prominent position, so that's certainly an area to focus on.\n\nOther options would be:-\n\n- Decentralise the state from London. Devolution is going to be key in the next few years anyway, but by pushing some key financial sectors out towards key Northern cities like Manchester and Leeds would help bring residential prices down in London and make the UK as a whole a more attractive place for young professionals to move to (I know a few people that have chosen different countries because they can't afford London, and their sector is London or nothing).\n\n- Introduce key new political legislation, including a scaling back of FPTP voting and the ability to appoint non-MPs (or Lords) as ministers (i.e. bring in actual industry experts instead of political careerists in fields they have no experience in), and have a forced \"cooldown\" period between cabinet reshuffles to avoid the revolving door we've seen recently that deadlocks progress.\nThis would give the UK government a chance to actually achieve a level of stability and focus on their actual manifesto, instead of infighting and grappling for power.\n\n- Invest much more seriously in arts and culture, particularly visual media - things that can easily get into peoples' homes. Grants for independent film studios to grow and build seems like a good start.",

It is wishful thinking for the UK to try to be a leading world power but it can be an important partner for many countries, UK shares history with many countries; it should lean on that and focus on its economy before trying to be a world power I mean, UK had it good in the EU. I don't know what the people thought that the UK would achieve by Brexit. I think the UK should rejoin the EU, work towards their economy, and then think about anything else because you can't lead the world with a small GDP. I know they have a high per capita, but still, they need a large GDP and a stable birthrate to reverse their decline, which does not seem likely. Even the best estimates point out that the UK will have a GDP of 4.2 trillion in 2028. It is impossible to lead the world when you are not even in the top five economy",

Severely handicapped by bad demographics and a self destructive government, plus many other issues.\n\nOtherwise you’re left with France and the UK. Two developed nuclear powers large enough to project military and soft power globally in a limited way. They can’t be world leaders like the USA but they can still project influence globally and be useful partners in many situations, particularly if they can improve their productivity and economic growth.",

It has a larger population than all of them combined and the circus in Italy is just getting started with the current scenario I do not know how they plan on reducing their debt, and since they have a birth rate lower than Japan, they can't fund a welfare state like any of the countries you mentioned",

Life in the Soviet Union was miserable compared to life in say Denmark, but in a war you'd rather live in the militarily powerful Soviet Union instead of defenseless Denmark. NATO came to be to help small European states mitigate their limited capabilities through consolidating into a much larger entity with the mass and scale to compete militarily with the Soviets.\n\nSize = Hard Power and Money = Soft Power. The Soviet Union did eventually fall to the West's Soft Power to be sure, but that victory was only possible because the Soviets couldn't smother Europe's Soft Power in its crib due to the immense size and scale of Western military might and because the Soviets could not provide a domestic alternative to the West's superior lifestyles which delegitimized their economic policies in the eyes of the common folks leading to the break down of the Soviet social contract.\n\nNation's can't really ***use*** Soft Power as it requires buy-in from the recipient unlike Hard Power which can be applied unilaterally. Soft Power can affect change through its influence, but that doesn't necessarily lead to any benefits being derived for the source of that Soft Power. Even if the entirety of Russia wholly adopted Denmark's culture, Denmark itself wouldn't really benefit from that transition besides maybe some extra money from Russian trade; Russia would still be considered one of the leading powers of Europe, not Denmark. The best Denmark could hope for in terms of growing its power would be to become a proxy for this new Danish Russia to support Denmark's interests over Europe, similar to how a lot of US allies seek favor with the US to have Washington push their policies onto the globe.\n\nHigh quality of life and high GDP per Capita are important factors for Soft Power and Soft Power itself is something not to be dismissed, but Soft Power is primarily a cultural force whose influence can legitimize or delegitimize policies and opinions; Soft Power on its own can't really affect a nation's political or military status but can cause discontent within rival nations when the social contract breaks down due to domestic policies/rulers being delegitimized.",

Switzerland is a good example of a strong country which is in Europe, but not EU. \n\nThe timeframe we are talking is in my opinion too insignificant to already come to a conclusion if it was good or bad to leave the EU.

If done early enough it does allow us to secure our interests in nearby strategically relevant regions, but in terms of population and economy Europe is shrinking, so this must necessarily be a rapid burst of energy to fortify Europe and her interests abroad before inevitable decline.\n\nIf Europe succeeds at this however, it's future may be surprisingly bright. While its fertility is abysmal, we don't know if this will last, and Europe went through the demographic transition earlier, slower and smoother than the rest of the world. This means if population stabilises Europe is among the first places where this might happen, and European fertility also hasn't collapsed as harshly as some other countries like Korea. It's possible that fertility in the third world will collapse far more so than in Europe. At the same time China and the US are having serious problems of different kinds.\n\nAll in all this presents a scenario where geopolitical competition is less about ascendancy and more about being the one to decline the least/slowest. If Europe can unite and secure her interests while she has the chance, then Europe is also well poised to survive such a conflict of attrition, particularly if the Union is willing to engage in Europe-wide industrial policy and a degree of protectionism to prop up industries of the future. Things like the EU's emphasis on the Green transition do suggest that with more budget and authority the Union's forward-looking attitude might be greatly beneficial to it in the long-run.",

I mean it's just one of the many reasons why I believe immigration in Canada is unsustainable they are importing our problems which they have no experience in solving , say what you will but Indians have found a way to live with these problems but struggle which we went through to attain this level is not something Canadians have an appetite for",

That's a winning combo, and likely makes India a superpower ... if internal dissent doesn't shake apart their state before then.\n2. **China** is possessed of an incredible amount of natural resources, a very large population, and dramatically increasing productivity and quality of life. However, their population is likely to be considerably lower in 2100 than it is now, especially in relative terms; provided they can weather the demographic cliff and continue per capita increases in productivity, they're set to be #2 in 2100.\n3. **Nigeria** may come as a surprise to most, but Africa's population, productivity and economy are projected to be the fastest growing (indeed, virtually the *only* consistently growing) in the world in the latter half of the century. Nigeria's very well positioned in Africa and is projected to have more than 500 million people in 2100; they're likely to be #3.\n4. **The USA** is likely to come in at #4 (or possible better). All other things unchanged, the US will see continued (much more modest) productivity gains and a much smaller population decline than many developed countries (due primarily to immigration). It also enjoys extremely peaceful relationships with its neighbors, self sufficiency in virtually all resources, the most defensible borders possible, and the ability to sustain itself on its domestic market if all else fails ... hence the upside. The US is among the best positioned countries in the world to endure a wide variety of disruptions (the failure of the globally interdependent economy, disruption from climate change, etc).",

None of them will be equivalent to the United States now, but the US position is extremely rare in world history and only possible because of the outcome of World Wars 1 & 2.\n\nNigeria has a huge and well educated diaspora that will be able to bring all sorts of new technologies, investments and skills into the country once the aging oligarchy dies off. It will be a rough transition, but once it’s made Nigeria will have all the opportunity in the world to grow.\n\nIndonesia has amazing natural resources and is well positioned along key trade routes. The population trends are positive and manageable for the country and it’s managed to stay friendly with key powers across the world. Its relative political and economic stability and huge internal market gives it a solid foundation for continued development. It’s also one of the few countries likely to receive substantial development from both emerging and established powers during this era of renewed competition.\n\nColumbia is also well positive population trends. It’s outside of the hurricane zone where storms are likely to intensify and a large portion of its population lives at higher elevations giving it some protections against the changing climate. It’s stability in the region and growing service sector make it the most competitive place for businesses wanting to serve Central and South America. Columbia also has many experienced diplomats helping it to manage key external relationships which will likely be key in the next 50 years.\n\nCanada has an aggressive immigration policy that has allowed it to collect talented individuals from across the world to bolster its workforce. If climate change progresses in a way that reduces the harshness of Canadian winters there’s a real possibility the country could use immigration to build new cities and increase its population into the north. Canada is the only developed country where this is a possibility and the impact it would have economically would be gigantic. Also the collecting of international elites into its workforce gives Canadian businesses high level global relationships they can leverage to remain competitive.\n\nVietnam is likely to benefit the most from anti China supply chain adjustments and has solid population trends to allow them to maintain a stable workforce. Out of this list Vietnam has the most skilled diplomats and is the best at identifying opportunities for foreign direct investment.\n\nHonorable mentions include Turkey, Mexico and Ethiopia. All of those countries are making solid moves and will be important regional powers. Mexico especially has nothing holding back its growth. I didn’t mention them because they seemed like safer and less interesting choices lol.",

                "comment_body": "**TLDR**\n\nEast or South East Asia may rise in importance as region in general, probably Japan will excel.\n\n----------\n\nBecoming a superpower is a complex issue, but at least there are pivotal factors affecting it and I would say CAUSING it: \n\n1. technology development (both vertical, i.e. pure innovation, and horizontal, i.e. production scalability). Tech dev is heavily intertwined with (in the US for example mostly driven by, in other cases integrating) military innovations and is a powerful leverage for economic stability\n2. military power, with special regard for maritime control of commercial routes. You can understand why googling \"EU asks US for help to fight Houthi in red sea\"\n3. human factor, which is a fancy term to say that you, as a nation, can't even try to raise yourself to the rank of superpower if your population isn't ready to fight and put everything at stake accepting the risk of losing. \n\nIf no major conflict happens and the US doesn't implode, we will see more or less the same situation in 100 years from now.\n\nAs of today it's very likely something's gonna change in East and South-East Asia (ESEA) in the next 100 years: \n\n1. SEA is, today, by far the major producer of technology in the world.  Those countries *will have the option of* being very technologically advanced, improving military sector and profiting out of tech.\n2. China-US conflict is not just about trade and tech, but also bout military. SEA countries will likely *have an option to* arm or re-arm, creating the basis for military presence or even military doctrine, intended as long-term military plans \n3. a lot of young population, surely more prone to fight than older population (as for example today's EU ppl). Some of those countries have also kind of successful history or past, which may play a role as \"internal propaganda\". \n\nAlso:\n\n* most of those countries today play on the razor's edge, now with China, now with US. As cold war has shown for some EU countries, playing the \"middleman game\" usually maximizes profit as both the major enemies are willing to invest in the middleman to keep yet another ally. This means that those countries will see rising cashflow in the following 10-20 years, and this creates an option for stable rich middleclass and for government expenditures\n* the more China-US goes on, the more these countries *will have options to* enrich and develop\n\nAs an educated guess, the whole area will grow economically. As of today, though, there is only one country far ahead of the others in the area besides China: Japan. \n\nIn the 80s Japan already had a Golden age of tech and it's still a very tech advanced country. Regarding military power, they are actively rearming with the placet and the help of the US. The only indicator that's not currently positive for Japan is the population, which is much older on average than other ESEA countries and maybe not ready to face a war or high intensity competition, but this may vary in the next 10-20 years.\n\n  \nOther ESEA countries are much younger than Japan in terms of national history and population but way behind in terms of tech and military capabilities. They may fill part of the gap or steer in the next 100 years, but as of today is really not possible to say. We can't say more than they're gonna have *options*",

Even if our best projections pan out for alternative energy, a significant amount of global warming is baked in. This is going to hit countries closer to the equator more strongly. I think that the economic and social impacts of this are going to rule out any country within perhaps 30 degrees of the equator from rising up to superpower status. That rules out potential big countries like all of Africa, India, Brazil, Indonesia, the rest of Southeast Asia, probably Iran + Saudi Arabia, Australia. \n\n\nIf you look at what that leaves, it's basically China, Europe + Russia, Japan, and Canada+US. With US and China still having significant southern/hotter portions that are heavily affected. \n\n\nI'm therefore really not seeing there be much room for a dramatic shift to a new unexpected world power. The \"Three-prong\" nature of the global economy where Europe, North America, and East Asia make up 70% of the world's GDP, is something I'm not seeing dramatically shift. ",

American is a corporate oligopoly under the veil of a representative democracy, corporate interests are why all those things you want will not happen. Both parties are in on it, and those “stupid wedge political issues” are maintained precisely because they distract the populace from fundamental class issues. The MIC thrives off fear and violent foreign policy, corporate interests spend millions to fight against wider healthcare, benefits like parental care and retirement, and regulation. Unless a fundamental shift happens in the mindset of the American people and changes are made to destroy financial and corporate influence on American politics, all those you want are not going to happen anytime soon",

I also never realized France had their own Afghanistan around 2016 in Mali, as they were fighting ISIS and Al Qaeda insurgents in Africa. And while we may see the UK as a fallen empire, their international reach is still global, and their influence global. The British empire never failed, it's just been slowly dying over the last century. \n\nSo while I do think a lot can and will change in the next century, I also think the USA, China, Russia, and Europe will continue to hold a higher place in the world order, at least for the next 50 years. Russia and China are facing steep population decline, but they still have a lot of power that doesn't just dry up overnight. Russia and China both have nukes, and large militaries, and strategic control of key areas.\n\nI do think we might see more African countries emerge as world influencers.

It's neo-colonialism vs direct colonialism. It's perhaps even a superior system of exploitation since colonialism was generally a line item expense for the state to the benefit of private enterprise. With neo-colonialism the now independent former colony foots the bill for administration of the state while its resources enrich the West.\n\nFor example, about 75% of mines in Africa are owned by Western corporations. The mineral resources of Africa enrich the West while the local population is simply cheap labor. This is why the CIA is constantly staging coups, arming and funding right wing death squads, terrorists, and the like.",

For most of hte last twenty years there was a large cohort that had money to invest as they moved into their late 40s and up.  Meanwhile, the amount of people in the younger cohorts that would normally generate demand (and costs) shrank fast.  For an export-oriented economy, this was a perfect recipe for massive growth.  But you can only do that once, and now it is over.\n\nThe second one is also clearly something that can only happen once.  You only get to industrialize one time.  It brings a lot of gorwth, but once it is done, it's done.  \n\nFinally, that first factor is about to turn into a heavy weight on the Chinese economy.  The same cohort that had money to burn over the last 15 years is now becoming a cohort that needs money and not only cannot support the kind of growth we have seen, but will become a huge drain on the economy.\n\nThe crises we are seeing are a combination of many things, but the ending of the above two highly positive economic tailwinds is a major and unsolveable driver of many of those problems.",

You can't tell a history of democracy without the US, and they were one of the most important nations in the world for almost it's entire existence. Any major event from the mid 19th century until it's collapse in the 21st will have the US in some kind of major role.\n\nAnd this is assuming there is no successor state to the US.

While we saw the Clinton miracle economy,  those funds were not invested well, and thus, we are where we are today. \n\nCouple that with the U.S. mucking up helping Russia and the former Soviet Republics right away in 1991, missing the opportunity to end the Cuban embargo, potentially getting Russia and North Korea to agree to a peace treaty to replace the month to month cease fire we have, and getting Russia and the other Eastern European countries into NATO.\n\nHistory books will see the Korean War as the first domino in the decline of the U.S., followed by Vietnam and Afghanistan. Iraq and the current unending war in Ukraine will be seen as icing on the cake for whatever else is coming that will put the final nail in the coffin ⚰️.  \n\nI think that the lack of universal health care and the U.S.'s lack of national strategy to educate our current population for tomorrow's professions will be seen as pillars of our downfall. \n\nWe also have awful trade strategies.  For instance, the $1 shipping of products that some countries like China enjoy comes from a subsidy that Americans pay so that poorer countries can ship items and remain competitive.  Countries like China do not need this. The auto trade imbalance is 400 to 1 with Japan. They import 1 car for every 400 we do. The U.S. cars that are imported in Japan have to be flawless and many times repainted and have other flaws fixed. They also charge higher import taxes on our cars than we charge them.

Story kinda goes like this: 1st generation earns it, 2nd generation grows it, 3rd generation blows it.\n\nIn the early 1600s the Dutch pretty much had it all. They were expanding all over the world, trading posts everywhere, riches just streaming in. It's why there was so much good art coming out of there... the artists were well-funded by wealthy traders.\n\nBut after three wars with the English, the \"new kids on the block\", it was pretty much all over less than a hundred years later.\n\nThe theory is that the later generations grew complacent and didn't really understand what was at stake. Or that infinite growth is unsustainable. And so there was no sense that folks needed to rein things in. People continued to live to excess and so on.\n\nObviously this is only a parallel in the most blurry 30,000 ft. view sense. There are a lot of differences.\n\nBut the general story is probably the same.\n\nWe're in the final stages of our empire... economic growth is down and it's becoming harder and harder for wealthy Americans to suck value out of the world around them as they are competing against wealthy Chinese, Saudis, Indians, etc. So they turn to other Americans....  We've become a middle-man economy where big corporations step in and demand \"small fees\" for stuff everybody did themselves. Businesses used to hire their own people, now recruiters and hiring businesses find bodies to exploit and take 20-30% from. Credit corporations provide services to land owners and hirers and make it harder for people not as well off to get homes and jobs. This is just one example of this \"great suck\" I'm talking about. This is the end of our empire. There is only so much value folks can give up though and eventually the middle class, still convinced it can be successful will start to cave in themselves. The upper classes, the 1-5%, will simply form their new conglomerations and describe it as \"democracy\" and \"freedom\", like they always do (our \"founding fathers\" were wealthy smugglers, about 1/3 of them, and complained about the lowest taxes anywhere in the United Kingdom).",

The people of the empires no longer had to provide and became an empire of users rather than producers.  The people of the empires then fought within themselves, since the populace within did not have to participate in the growth anymore.  This is how other empires fell in the past over centuries.  The idea is learning from history and not repeating history.  The US is erasing history from within to promote the change of this country.  I feel that in the history of Empires, the US would be ranked the lowest, if even ranked.  History will be lost and there will be no context of an empire.

The border is still wide open with millions of 3rd world populations streaming in that can't even speak English.  This is MAJOR problem and a major source of weakness. We can't have that. The United States is a VERY different country than it was at the end of WW2, when the country was at it's zenith. That's a whole different topic but I would venture to say that the current government will fall from within from inner turmoil or possibly from military conflict because the current rulers still think it's 1980 and that they can bully the rest of the world and get away with it. Our manufacturing base has been completely decimated. We longer have the surge capacity that we did in WW2. Our brain dead leaders will get us into another great war and this time we will be on the losing end as we always have been since ww2.

The U.S. economy was already larger than the U.K. economy by then, but the Empire still represented a massive \"common market\" and \"free trade zone\".  Someone in Scotland could invest in Indian Railway Bonds, or a Malayan rubber plantation, or an African cattle ranch, with no currency risk, or political risk, and few, if any, tax or regulatory problems; and the U.S. was on the outside looking in. The U.S. wanted to break that system and economically (though not politically) take over the British colonies, the way the U.S. economically (though not politically) dominated Central and South America.\n\nBoth the Soviest and the U.S. generated political pressure for the British and French Empires to grant independence to their colonies, (albeit for different reasons) and the European powers were to weak from two world wars to resist. \n\nWith the British Empire gone, and the USSR on the march, the U.S. suddenly found itself stuck with the role of \"World Policeman\", which most Americans didn't really want. None the less the U.S. found itself stuck with Britian's former role as the planet's dominant naval power, and stuck with dirty jobs like fighting Communist gurellias in the Third World, playing \"Balance of Power\" in Central Europe, practicng strategic deterance to keep the peace, preventing piracy, keeping the sea lanes open and the world economy going, paying for infrastructre projects in the Third World, etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe U.S. has done this for about 75 years now, but the Brits were doing it for much longer, and first. Given the common cultural background, future historians will lump the two together and see the U.S. much the same way we currently see  Odoacer's Kingdom of Italy, or perhaps the Byzantine Empire.

It also has oil. \n\nBut some territories which came from the old US will fare worse than others. The south has too many people who are so illiterate they can barely talk, and while there are many brilliant people in the south there probably are not enough of them to draw up a coherent economy there. \n\nCalifornia has WAY too many people living in basically arid landscapes. It’s not like 1830 when you had 500,000 people spread out across the entire state. You have like 50 million now. \n\nThe Midwest has very arable land and relative climate stability perhaps except for occasional flooding in some areas.\n\nI think a broken up U.S. would resemble Latin America",

There are plenty of more major and devastating events that have gone almost unnoticed. The Spanish flu killed 3% of the world’s population, and I doubt most people can even date when it happened.

He worked at a steel mill at the time having barely graduated high school and was making not that much more than minimum wage. The consensus of his friends at the time was that it had \"taken him too long\" to buy a house.  He divorced his wife a year later and just signed the house over to her to be done with everything, having met my mom. He assumed he would be able to afford a new house in no time, and I was born in 1978. Turns out he could not. \n\nToday, I live in the same neighborhood as he did in 1975. His 45 year old son can barely, just barely paycheck to paycheck, afford a one bedroom apartment in that same neighborhood. And I'll spare you the details, but I am far more educated than \"barely graduated high school.\" \n\nI realize that is a purely anecdotal story, but there are tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of anecdotal stories like that one today. \n\nIn what way has the United States of America not been in sharp economic decline for the general population since 1980?",

WW1 proved him wrong on that when all the Workers of Europe happily joined up with their local bourgeoisie and went out to slaughter each other in the trenches of the Western Front...(and other locations as well).  Then, after Socialist Revolution actually happened in Russia, the German, British, French, American and Japanese (not to mention Polish, Czech, and Russian) workers all joined with THEIR bourgeoisie to fight AGAINST the Socialist Revolution(!!).\n\nIf you were a true believer in Socialism, this was a major fly in your ideological ointment. It kind of undermined the whole thing. \n\nSo Mussolini developed the theory that Socialism was still the way forward into the Progressive future, and that Socialism would still lead to the workers paradise that Marx predicted, and that violent revolution and totalitarian government, and that governmental control of the economy and violent supression of poplitical opponents were still needed to build this better future; but he chose to organize this struggle not as a class struggle (as Marx had) but as a NATIONALIST struggle... because Nationalist Struggles were what was going on in Europe at the time. \n\nHence the name \"National Socialism\".\n\nItalian Workers and Italian Bourgeoisie would join, under the Italian Socialist Party leadership and control, to build an Italian Workers Paradise. This still required centralizing political and economic authority under an autocrat and his or her cronies (as Marxisim does) but it was done NOT in the name of \"World Revolution\" (which scared the Brits, French, and Americans, and wasn't happening anyway) but in the name of (borrowing a phrase from Stalin here) \"building Socialism in one country\".  The whole \"restoring the nation to a glorious past\" was icing on the cake, designed to appeal to the people of a second (or third) rate nation that was covered in the ruins of a richer, more powerful, and more glorious empire. \n\nAdmittedly the centralized economic power in Fascisim is indirect (allowing the elite to continue being rich and owning companies) rather than the more direct (\"Eat The Rich!\") approach of Marxisim, but it is still governmental control of the means of produciton in the end.\n\nThis suited Hitler's racial and racist ideas to a T. The idea of the \"heroic Aryan Race\" struggling against all comers fit perfectly with Mussolini's idea of Socialism built not a class basis, but a national one, so he jumped on this. \n\nThe point is, in theory, in origin, and in practice, Nazism is simply another form of Socialism. \n\nAfter WW2 the folks in the Frankfurt School, (and other Socialists) had to scramble to come up with a story to obscure this rather inconvienent truth, and they did so quite successfuly. \n\nNonetheless, in reality, the National Socialist German Workers' Party WAS just what it said it was, Socialist.",

Does it mean the history taught in school?  The academic history and that discussed by people well-read and closely interested?

                "comment_body": "Mate, your argument sounds like it’s stuck in the past and ignores how much the global balance of power has changed. You’re banking on the idea that the U.S.'s geography and resources will keep it on top forever, but that’s a pretty limited take in today’s globalised world.\n\nFirst off, you’re going on about the U.S.'s economic and technological dominance like it’s unshakeable, but have you even seen what China’s been up to over the last few decades? They’ve become the second-largest economy in the world and built an industrial and tech base that’s now on par with the U.S., if not ahead in some areas. Companies like Huawei, Tencent, and Alibaba aren’t just domestic players—they’re leading globally in AI, telecommunications, and e-commerce. The U.S. isn’t “gapping” anyone anymore. China’s pouring money into R&D and churning out more engineers and scientists than the U.S. could dream of. So thinking America’s guaranteed to stay ahead in tech is nothing but wishful thinking.\n\nNow, about your energy argument—China doesn’t have to sit around waiting for Russia to fall apart to fix any energy issues. They’ve already got long-term deals in place across the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. Plus, their Belt and Road Initiative hasn’t just expanded their trade network—it’s secured critical energy supplies. And let’s not forget, China’s leading the world in renewables. They’re smashing it when it comes to solar and wind power, and their investments in nuclear energy are off the charts. In any global conflict, China’s energy sources would be a lot harder to disrupt than you think. The world isn’t as simple as just cutting off supply chains anymore.\n\nYou also seem to have this blind faith in the U.S. military, but that’s not the trump card you think it is. Sure, they’ve got a big military, but China’s been modernising theirs for years, focusing on smart strategies like cyber warfare, anti-ship missiles, and space capabilities. They don’t need to match the U.S. weapon-for-weapon—they just need to counter American advantages. And let’s be honest, any real conflict would happen in East Asia, where China has the upper hand geographically. They control key sea lanes and have a strong military presence in the South China Sea. The U.S. would have a hell of a time maintaining dominance in that region.\n\nYou throw out “authoritarian rule” like it’s automatically a disadvantage, but you’re missing the point. China’s political system gives them stability and the ability to plan long-term, unlike the U.S., which gets caught up in political chaos and changes direction every few years. While America swings between polarising administrations, China’s been able to push massive projects like the Belt and Road Initiative without any of the partisan rubbish. That’s why their influence is spreading so rapidly around the globe.\n\nAs for China’s demographics, it’s not the crisis you make it out to be. They’re already addressing it by pushing automation and high-tech industries, reducing their reliance on manual labour. China’s making huge strides in AI and robotics, which will more than make up for any labour shortages. You’re acting like this is the end of China’s rise, but really it’s just them evolving to the next stage.\n\nAnd your idea that U.S. immigration is some unbeatable superpower? That’s not looking too flash with how American politics is going. Immigration policies are tightening, and the “melting pot” isn’t as welcoming as it used to be. Meanwhile, China’s investing in building a highly skilled domestic workforce—they don’t need to rely on immigration like the U.S.\n\nIn a nutshell, your argument is stuck on old ideas about geography, energy, and military strength, while completely ignoring how China has adapted to overcome these very challenges. The U.S. isn’t in the untouchable position you seem to think it is, and China’s already shown they’re more than capable of competing at the top, especially as the world moves towards multipolarity.",

The obvious case in point is how China managed to squander their position after the first year of covid, when the West was in chaos. Talk about alienating nearly all their biggest trade partners, betting on Putin, single handedly destroying HK’s reputation, and then keeping stupid zero covid policies and shutting down Shanghai for nearly two months with total disregard of foreign investors confidence. Now they are spooked and won’t come back, and the ccp also think it was good timing to set back their own economy by clamping down on tech and property. So now local governments do not have money and sheepishly China now has to act nicer to entice western investment back but how easy can you even mend the broken trust.

With goods the cheaper manufacturing costs the broader access of the market you will have. Unless some miraculous plan other countries became that much wealthier than America, the only places they can sell their made in USA goods is probably Europe? China is no longer possible given current geopolitical tensions (including export restrictions) and also one of their key sectors being cars is being outcompeted by Chinese domestic EVs.\n\nHousing: much like most of the western world and even in China is treated like some speculative asset. The problem is having strong housing prices is kind of paper economy. It's something that doesn't produce economic value aside from it's supposed potential to appreciate over time? Much like in 2008 it can face a huge pop.\n\nBreadbasket is great if you're planning an agricultural society. Being able to sustain your population is all that matters and for advanced economics that really is most you need to keep an eye out for.\n\nTheir dollar dominance has allowed them to game the system of partially alleviating inflation when they print currency.

Huawei is leading in 5G technology globally, and their telecommunications infrastructure is being used worldwide, from Europe to Africa. The U.S. literally had to create bans and push allies to avoid their tech because they couldn’t outcompete them head-on. When was the last time you saw the U.S. banning companies because they couldn’t keep up? That’s not a sign of weakness on China’s part—that’s dominance.\n\nOn AI, you’re saying no Chinese company can compare to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google? You’re missing the broader picture. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is one of the most advanced uses of AI in the consumer space today, and it’s shaping how Western companies operate. ByteDance is on par with, if not ahead of, Silicon Valley when it comes to AI-driven content recommendation. And don’t forget Baidu—while you might not use it, their work in AI and autonomous driving is significant. They’ve got projects in quantum computing too, which is hardly a joke. Just because they aren’t as well-known in the West doesn’t mean they aren’t doing serious innovation.\n\nNow, on Nvidia—yeah, they’re the gold standard for GPUs, no doubt. But China isn’t sitting on the sidelines. They’ve been pushing to develop their own chip-making capabilities, especially with companies like SMIC, and have been making massive strides in supercomputing. The U.S. is so worried about China’s progress in semiconductors that they’re throwing sanctions left and right to slow them down. You don’t see them putting that kind of effort into countries that aren’t a threat.\n\nAs for Alibaba, calling it “janky” is missing the point. It’s not about flashy UI; it’s about the backend infrastructure and market reach. Alibaba powers huge portions of China’s e-commerce market, as well as global B2B transactions. They’ve also developed one of the world’s largest cloud platforms, Alibaba Cloud, which competes directly with AWS in Asia. E-commerce isn’t just about what looks good to you; it’s about efficiency and scale, both of which Alibaba excels at.\n\nLastly, the whole “paying tribute to the CCP” line is just lazy. Every major company, whether in China or the West, has to navigate political landscapes—just look at how much lobbying happens in Washington or how U.S. companies toe the line on data privacy. Saying Chinese companies only exist because of the CCP ignores their massive innovation and success in the global market. TikTok didn’t take over the world because of CCP support, it did so because it’s a damn good product with cutting-edge AI behind it.\n\nIn short, you’re looking at China through a narrow, outdated lens. They’re not just playing catch-up anymore—they’re competing and often leading in multiple fields. Silicon Valley’s dominance isn’t guaranteed forever, and China’s already proving they can go toe-to-toe.",

In truth, the Chinese model is showing cracks and even the Chinese (and North Koreans) rhetorically frame themselves as a \"socialist democracy\". Only maybe Saudi Arabia makes no pretenses at being democratic and embraces being a full-blown absolute monarchy.\n\nCircling back, we should not take the triumph of democracy for granted. The French Revolution's heady democratic promises were followed by Napoleon's empire. Similarly, there have been worries of a democratic reversal or decline even within the Western world. \n\nRather than a foreign autocracy overtaking the United States, it is not inconceivable that a populist strongman could subvert American democracy from the inside.\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the engagement in your replies below, I took my time to read through each of them. \n\nSome additional food for thought: Democracy as an ideal is unassailable compared to Authoritarianism. We are willing to lay down our lives on the alters of freedom and liberation. So much so that pragmatic authoritarian states try to co-opt some of this democratic legitimacy rather than set themselves up in opposition to democracy. \n\nHowever, we must acknowledge that Democracy in practice is fallible. If we do not want history to revert to the mean, that is for authoritarianism to become dominant again (just under the wrappings of elections), we must not be lulled into blindly believing Democracy's triumph is eternal or inevitable.",

                "comment_body": "The problem with autocratic systems is threefold: they are personality-driven, unsustainable, and by their very nature restrict economies. \n\nTo maintain control of the state, it isn’t just a strong leader, but it is THAT strong leader. The second that person is no longer strong, all of the bridesmaids fight for the bouquet. They know this, so they prepare by hoarding money, undermining the security infrastructure to favor them, and seek to replace competency with loyalty. The autocrat is at the advantage when they are in power, which means the remainder factionalizes and when the leader is gone, they fight for his resources. When the leader does not have a predictable time limit on power, it just gets worse and worse.\n\nBecause of the first problem, along with the limited capacity of a single person who fears delegation to run things, autocracies are unsustainable. Beyond issues of peaceful transitions between leaders, autocracies also require a level of control that far exceeds one person. Through loyalty testing, oppression, and an intelligence structure beholden only to them, a leader can stave off this effect through loyal agents, but every delegated power is a power lost. The entropy in this system is immense. (All systems have entropy, autocracies have some of the worst cases)\n\nBut neither of those reasons is the real reason autocracies fail. Autocracies fail because they NEED corruption, patronage, and hoarding to function. When a society is free, the wealth is (better) distributed, but then so is the power, which feeds back into the distribution of money.   Empowering the citizenry promotes growth which brings in more wealth (power) which is distributed among a greater number of people. That power can then be used to prevent loyalty testing, oppression, and the co-optation of government institutions by the regime, especially law enforcement, the military, and intelligence. \n\nI won’t get into how the entropy in a democratic/capitalist system works here, because this isn’t my graduate thesis, but it matters that the individualistic, democratic ideals underpin the distribution of wealth (which degrade in a different way from autocratic systems). \n\nFinally, there are correlated traits we have observed in autocratic systems that prevent development, wealth, pragmatic distribution, and encourage corruption. For example, explicit ethnic-based systems are unsustainable for their own reasons, and tend to provide the core power bae for the autocrat. As these groups degrade in power, we get ethnic cleansings and apartheid, to name a few outcomes. \n\nOther issues, like the psychology of the leader (which tends to get more paranoid and cruel over time), foreign relations (especially arms sales, aid, and FDI) are more difficult the longer a single person is in power, and poverty and social safety nets tend to favor the elites much more in autocratic systems.\n\nIf I had to provide a metaphor: as a system succumbs to entropy, the more flexible and distributed it is, the greater the resiliency. Autocratic systems are not only more rigid and centralized, but they ‘crystallize’ over time at a faster rate as they attempt to counter this entropy. The less flexible they become, the faster they degrade and the more severe the effects of the degradation. \n\nYMMV",

The dominant western narrative is usually that it is authoritarian or autocratic. Whether authoritarian is the same as autocratic would probably depend on who you ask.

This is a very stable political arrangement, because all the guy(s) at the top have to do is ensure a critical mass of the security forces support them to maintain power.  They and their friends get a lot of extra undeserved money.  I feel like we see this all the time with authoritarian countries to the point that it's a trope (the dictator comes to mind) but don't always examine the why.\n\nThe key issue is that open economies have only really existed, and can only really exist, in the context of liberal democracy, and they develop together.  Each step towards liberal democracy and open economy enables the other.  So you can't have an open economy and an authoritarian system.  In other words, authoritarian countries will always have shit economies compared to liberal democracies.  (the sad flip side here is that a liberal democracy is anti-stable in a way, with the potential for a quick decline if/when rule of law for elites, open economy, civilian control of the military, or a number of other key conditions are violated).\n\nI hope it's kind of clear that democracies with open economies (the only kind that exist) have an innate economic advantage relative to authoritarians with closed economies.  The result of this dynamic is that authoritarian countries are unlikely to be the most powerful on earth, because a democracy (or coalition of democracies) will be able to out-spend them on the military, even when spending a much smaller share gdp on the military.\n\nAuthoritarian countries can politically spend a much higher share of gdp on the military, and the few militarily competitive (regionally, let's not exaggerate) authoritarian countries are typically getting *a lot* from mineral wealth, i.e. free money laying underground (not from high value add economic activity).  But in any long run scenario liberal democracies seem to be a kind of  optima with respect to social and political organization (local optima at least, the philosipher king is out there somewhere...).",

                "comment_body": "From a book called Democracy and Markets, the theory was that when economies require more manpower, like rice making agrarian countries or oldschool manufacturing, then the elites and commoners need each other to produce wealth, and since any party can disrupt production, they are more democratic. However in economies that require few people to produce output, like cattle ranching and highly automated technology, elites can do what they want and ignore the commoners. Then you end up with that being reflected in dictatorships. However, if either the commoners or elites take over for a short time and worry that they will lose power, they build institutions that entrench their power. So, even though America doesnt need mass workers for output anymore, the democracy is an entrenched.\n\nBut for places like China, the elites are pretty well entrenched.\n\nEither way, one view is that the gov is a reflection of the economy.\n\nIn this theory, China has many people working in low tech manufacturing and being laid off from factory automation. The entrenched elites have many commoners to keep tabs on, even with their modern tech. Furthermore, China has a long history of commoners rebelling when things get too bad. It seems that the elites are now going back and centralizing power in The CCP.\n\nSo honestly, I think that either China will become more democratic through reform or rebellion, or they will stagnate in the middle income trap.\n\nI think another analysis for why China would stagnate in thr middle income trap is that Kings of Europe in the 1600s had the option to sign some of their authority over tax law and economies. The kings who did that or who went from autocratic monarchys to parliamentarian monarchies gained more stable economic laws that attracted investors and merchants. We see a similar effect today where dictators who have the ability to rapidly change economic laws, like What China did recently to their IT and private edu sectors, don't do as well economically as countries that have a more democratic setup that makes changing laws both harder, and open for more factions to consider the pros and cons of a legal change. So, attracting high profit sectors, like finance is harder when your laws can change any time and investors have highly moble capital.\n\nFurthermore, another simpler analysis is the education your country prioritizes matters. People make fun of The American edu system for teaching the workforce for an industrial revolution when innovating makes more money. However, China, Japan, S. Korea, Indonesia, India, Hong Kong, and other nations in the region prioritize critical thinking and innovation skills even less than USA edu. This is one hypothesis why first world nations in the area. Like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and S. Korea has a gdp/capita far behind The USA. But if China gave everyone an education that focused on critical thinking, then many commoners in China would want democracy and liberty, knowing that its in their best interests. Then the present regime would be in trouble. So, its unlikely the present regime would do that. Then we are back to a middle income trap.\n\nGiven that no country other than China, I am doubtful that western democracies will fall behind dictatorships.",

There's less room to lie without being investigated for it, which means less wiggle room for lying for government handouts. This gives a more accurate picture of national needs, and a better proportional distribution of resources to address those need. \n\nAutocratic leadership's are also inherently more likely to be biased for institutions of power.

I'm basing my opinion off of the book \"why nations fail\" by Daron acemoglu.\n\nDemocratic countries have inclusive political institutions which means that not just that we vote in elections to choose our representatives but also there is free press, freedom of religion etc. This means that an entrenched elite similar to the European feudal aristocracy or an authoritarian junta cannot develop in our countries. The reason why this is important is because once an elite becomes entrenched and new blood cannot enter the top of the pyramid, it becomes in their economic interests to change inclusive economic institutions to extractive economic institutions as they no longer stand to gain from new businesses with new ideas and instead want to preserve monopolies and extract wealth from the population. We also have secure property rights and patent system! Why would you invest capital into developing a new technology if the government could just take it or if anyone could just steal it easily\n\nInclusive economic institutions generally exist in liberal countries meaning that if you have a good idea then you can have a go at trying it out generally which will increase productivity of liberal economies and create a process of 'creative destruction' whereby new ideas will destroy old industries or ways of working and lead to more things being produced for cheaper costs. These institutions exist as a result of the inclusive political institutions and cannot exist without them.\n\nAuthoritarian countries struggle to engage in creative destruction because there is an entrenched elite in whose economic interest it is most certainly not to disrupt the companies they control or the monopolies they have over the economy. Why innovate and change the way you do things when you're already making money hand over fist and potentially no longer be the top dog?\n\nEconomic growth can happen in extractive countries, the book showcases the USSR which had massive gdp growth after the 2nd world war but which wasn't driven by creative destruction and was instead driven by the reallocation of resources by changing an agricultural workforce into an industrial workforce but new ideas were not created.\n\nI think the same thing is occurring in China, we've seen massive gdp growth over the past few decades from their moving their agricultural workforce into cities but once that's done, they will find it difficult to truly innovate and change the way their businesses work at the same rate that liberal democracies are able to do.\n\nFeel free to disagree!",

Today it seems to mean checks and balances between executive/legislative/judicial branches, limited (executive/legislative) branches and rule of law. Some democracies seem to be capitalist societies too that allow social mobility based on merit.  \n\nI would argue that the rise of individualism (as opposed to religious, feudalism centric society) with its emphasis on *fair* chance is what made democracies flourish.  An interesting aspect of a democracy is that democracy is for losers.  Those who lose power in an election (the loser) cede power to another group (the winners) knowing they will have a fair chance to win it back. Thus allowing for commerce and long term investment to exist due to this inherent stability.\n\nA country like North Korea for example where every citizen believes they gets their fair chance/share from the supreme leader can work in lieu of a democracy if North Korea had a large deposit of oil/gold etc and could self sustain with minimal graft from the elites.  This didn’t work in Venezuela first example since they didn’t have such a cohesive society.  Saudi Arabia is an example for a self sustaining economy that rules with an iron fist but will likely collapse without oil to inter tribal warring. \n\nIn the future with advances in AI there may be a way to run an economy via a central planning authority, making nanny states the provide basic services for citizens.

Ideally in my view, Trumpism is crushed so badly no-one dares to admit to supporting him in the future, but that's very illiberal. I just don't see how the contradiction is resolved. It has to be crushed for the health of body politic but to crush it you have to compromise core values. It looks like a horrible recipe for chaos, that I fear is unsustainable.",

The thesis of the book is poverty is characterized by various forms of \"unfreedom\" and that we can't consider a nation truly \"developed\" until basic freedoms are stabilized. Put in my own words freedom is more than just a \"nice to have\" it is a hard requirement of development. Authoritarians are capped at a uncertain but certainly impovrished level. China is an interesting example where what development has occurred was fueled by investments of free countries, though the chinese remained authoritarian. When that freedom capital is withdrawn china will sink back to its 1970s reality. I do not see any legitimate challenges to the hegemony of the free world, in fact the gulf will only widen in the coming years.",

Firstly it can be decisive, and get things done regardless of alternatives/ it can decide while democracies can perpetually debate or litigate an issue. Which is of value to society when it is a collective goal. Secondly consistency, you can plan much further out on a social level without issues such as an election picking up a new plan and starting again.\n\nThat said, if the plan is a bad plan, or the plan is to enrich yourself and not society, we end up with the inherent weakness of authoritarianism. And such things are stable until they are not like glass.\n\nDemocracy can be more stable as it has pressure relief strategies via courts, checks, traditions, and elections. It  can hash out better plans when they are truly tested. Also, people tend to inherently support the system as they are part of it rather than accepting it via force. Its more like steel or wood in that it can bend to pressure.\nThat said some Of the flaws in democracy are direct counterpoints to autocratic regimes but not all.\n\nAt the moment the world is in serious flux, there are many serious challenges and questions to navigate. From climate change to rapid technological revolution, to the collapse of religion as a guiding moral purpose, to shifting resource requirements and scarcity. Also, the question of nonintervention vs collective action to solve these problems think Brexit, MAGA, china FP vs the Federalists in Europe, the African Union, the UN etc etc\n\nAs a race we are currently trying to work out what to do. Many different ideas are fighting for dominance in the world, and NOT deciding is worse than a bad plan. Ultimately we want “shit done” and collectively we are sick of half measures eg building houses, solving immigration/demographic decline, making us richer, the transition from fossil fuels, solving climate change, save us from AI tyranny. As such as a collective group we are looking at autocracy as a way to break the stalemate and solve these issues. All the autocrats running in elections are spouting getting stuff done think Rodrigo Roa Duterte “kill all The drug dealers”, or trump bring back manufacturing/ maga, Geert Wilders and dealing with immigrants,brazil when bosinaro was in power ,or brexit and farage.\n\n\nThat said regimes like China russia. Or Saudi is not fully providing solutions to these issues either. Plus a significant number of autocrats in democracies have also failed to deliver. Thus its not a done deal that we slide that way. Ultimately the regime That demonstrates it is delivering for its constituents consistently will be the regime that prevails over the next 50 years",

I would reccomend reading Daron Acemoglu’s books for analysis of why this is very connected to the emergence of democratic institutions. Authoritarian regimes have more challenges in building and sustaining highly productive economies— their institutions tend to be eventually favour rent seeking by the politically connected elite. Transparency and rule of law are important for investment.\n\nThere are certainly exceptions, but the issues China is having right now are actually pretty symptomatic of why authoritarian systems have so much trouble sustaining economic success. Yes, with good leadership they can do it, but once they have bad leadership (and Xi is incompetent) they have no means to get rid of it or restrain it’s worst impulses. There are good reasons why all the wealthiest nations in the world, outside petrostates and Singapore (which is semi-democratic), are liberal democracies\n\nThis doesn’t mean an authoritarian regimes couldn’t overcome the major democracies, but it would be more difficult",

The comparability here should be a comparability in starting material conditions and scale for said countries.\n\nChina is a Billion+ people multi civilizational country that came into its modern form and system, gaining its independence and coalescing into a coherent and relative to its history stable nation state, in the late 40s. And at that point in time it was still semi feudal with almost medieval QoL metrics for the vast majority of its population.\n\nIt seems to me that the country, and democracy that is, most comparable to all that is India. A country of comparable scale that came into its modern form,independance and statehood in the same period in time. With the starting conditions as far as QoL, level of industrialization, development of productive forces goes being comperably garbage or even favoring India tho at that low level it doenst matter.\n\nSo how does China compare unfavorably in its economy and development to the most comparable country democracy next door ?\n\nUnless we somehow chose Taiwan, Singapore, Japan or SK as the most comparable democracies (who all were non democratic for the biggest part of modern China's existance ,are of much smaller scale, some already industrialized with better starting conditions or were heavily subsidized by Marshall Plan like direct assistance by being US protectorates in the erea ) that should be pittied against China in an analysis of historical develpment then i dont see how the argument holds.",

Only for male citizens - property holders and slave owners. Women and slaves? Just don't think about them. Also don't question how Athens practiced democracy at home and imperialism abroad...\n\nI'm sure I don't need to explain to you how Rome didn't last very long as a Republic...\n\nEdit: \"Democracy is an anomaly\" doesn't mean that Democracy is something new that never existed before in history. I think that's why you think Greece and the Roman Republic are such \"gotcha\" counter-examples. What is new and anomalous is the modern-day acceptance of democracy as the dominant and just status quo. \n\nEven during the times of ancient Greece and Rome, democracy was seen as something radical and unsustainable, only fit for a city-state like Athens and certainly not fit for administering an empire. Plato and Socrates' opinions on democracy therefore help to enlighten us to this rejection of democracy back then.\n\nFurthermore, both Greece and Rome's republics eventually succumbed to authoritarian takeover. Philip of Macedon conquered Athens and an internal strongman took over Rome (500 years of Republicanism notwithstanding).",

They lack some of the accountability mechanisms that democracies have, like free media and more independent police and judiciary, plus autocrats usually stay in power by rewarding their supporters with state spoils (so corruption is baked into the way the system works).",

Hitler often intentionally gave vague orders to his subordinates so they would quarrel with each other. And German military officers had quite a lot of operational latitude in how to do their work, but I’ll concede that Hitler, especially later in the war, did directly intervene and cause issues.",

In reality British colonialism in India didnt result in significant material or economic disadvantages when compared to 1940s China. Looking at the state both countries were at the point in time they formed their modern independant states and concluding that China has a significant headstart simply isnt supported by any actual analysis. And even if there was some vague headstart shouldnt democracy vs autocracy cause the gap to close rather than widen by a lot ? Thats supposed to be the thesis of this whole thread. \n\nOf course you can do \"actualy India no real democracy\" and or you can find another country thats had more comparable starting conditions to China than India and also was a REAL democracy through modern history .

An open society fosters difficult conversations that improve military preparedness. \n\nThe best example of the opposite case right now is Russia, which has a ton of natural resources, industrial capacity, and technical institutional knowledge base. But the lack of personnel development and the relative concentration of power into a small clique (some individuals of whom are not qualified to lead their institutions) led to a highly inefficient military. Sure, most likely Russia will freeze the Russo-Ukrainian war at the existing borders and maybe even win if Ukraine loses all support.

Partly because local governments main source of income is the sale of land, so there's a very strong incentive to make that land as valuable as possible. Everyone knows about 'ghost cities' and the huge oversupply of housing which is probably in the range of >100 million uninhabited homes. While the economy and urban population were growing like there's no tomorrow, that wasn't a huge problem because there was always a chance that five or ten years into the future demand for that infrastructure would appear. \n\nBut now China's population is aging rapidly and total population has actually begun to fall, most of the rural people have moved to the cities so there's no more 'internal immigration' possible to create urban demand for real estate. I wouldn't call it stagnated, but the economy has matured. The existing oversupply will never be used, meaning real estate businesses are facing massive write-offs which has all sorts of knock-on effects for the broader Chinese economy. Because of the CCP's strict rules on finances, most Chinese could not invest their money in bonds or stocks like in the West, so basically all that was left was real estate, i.e. buying a second or third home to sell later at a premium. But with demand and prices falling, rather than making a profit a lot of people will see their savings go up in smoke. \n\nFurthermore, the pace of new construction will also fall a lot. In the past decade, China was building around 6 million new homes per year. Due to existing oversupply and consequently decreased demand, that number will probably have to decrease by >80%. Which means that (tens of) millions of construction workers and business have to move into other parts of the economy, which will not be without friction. \n\nChina isn't doomed, but deflating the largest real estate bubble in history without crashing the economy and ending up in years of economic depression is one fine needle to thread. Time will tell if the CCP is able to do it.",

If it is a price shock like currently seen with energy prices and food, there is not much to be done about that by the central banks. This can be seen in japan, where they didnt increase interest rates and the prices still came down. In this instant the president can employ policies like a tax cut on the specific ressources or even put fixed prices in place. A problem of that could be the increased demand, which encourages detrimental environmental issues. But as the priceshock is rather short term, it is ok to do so (out of a social perspective).\n\nIf its about normal inflation, the president can also do things like cut spending to reduce demand. I personally think, that fiscal policy in general is much more important than monetary policy since you can specifically target industries that have highest price increases. A higher interest rate targets all sectors equally, which is a problem for some industries that arent even at full capacity. (Btw nowerday its believed by economists, that inflation increases if a economy produces at maximum capacity and demand increases even more. „More Money equals inflation“ is not very acepted academically anymore.",

Look at the end of Reagan into Clinton, Bush into Obama, Trump into Biden. Spending to receipts skyrockets at the end of Bush and Trump (for Reagan it was his whole 2nd term, let's be real) and those effects ripple sometimes for years). Foreign investments are directly affected by outlooks of the FED and the cabinet, yet this is largely due to some speculation by investors of course. This is a topic I could talk FOR DAYS about and I'm oversimplifying but great point made by yourmomsucks that I had to harp on.",

Cutting the money supply will not inherently decrease inflation, because it could cut supply even more. The accurate way to look at the question is to consider all the factors and how they interconnect. In this specific example, there’s widespread agreement that the determining factor in post-COVID inflation cannot merely be money printing, because some places like the US that had higher spending ultimately had lower inflation!",

I understand this is a common tactic, but let's drop these ways of speaking and try to think critically. \n\nPrices are a result of supply and demand, ultimately. Yes corporate greed plays a role in trying to live through hard times while feeling no consequences. But there's a far larger principle that must be upheld of agency despite this - not removed because of it. \n\nAnyone who wants to live in as free of a country as possible understands this. Just because the rules didn't serve you this time, doesn't mean you should go trying to create harsher ones or bend the rules until they are. The cost of freedom IS that there are more risks but also the opportunity for more reward. Adding rules brings everyone without power under a low thumb. Nobody wins but the elite even moreso in this situation, but the elites just wear a different suit than what you're imagining them to. \n\nYou can't just stop at the idea that the government will come to rescue you. If you want to live in a dictatorship, try looking at some first. This type of control is also used to reach a much worse end goal of total power and control. Idk why you want that so badly. (Using your speaking tactic there.)\n\nAlso, I'll say it again, there are the exact same people you think they aren't out there dressed in a way you like, offering false promises you agree with.

The problem, I think, comes in the disconnect between these very real conditions and the office of the presidency. It makes sense to want just one person with the power of the federal government to come in and fix everything, alleviate these conditions, but the economy is way too complex for that.\n\nHowever, we can look at data like the consumer price index which looks at inflation on real goods, the purchases we make for survival: https://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/consumer-prices-oecd-12-2023.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi26vjchP6DAxXSkokEHQeXDc4QFigAegQIFRAA&usg=AOvVaw10tYlKhu9YXcyhlKY3Kivv\n\nAnd what we see is that ... the US has done a better at fighting inflation than any of the other major countries in the world maybe save Japan. If you moved to Canada, the UK, Germany, etc. things would be even worse than they are here. That means Biden's policies have had a real effect.\n\nPart of what you're experiencing is that during COVID, global supply chains were disrupted and the cost was passed on to the consumer. Well those have been resolved but companies didn't magically lower their prices back to what they were. Biden has no control over that.\n\nMeanwhile month after months, quarter after quarter, things ARE getting better here. And for those who are invested the stock market is booming.

Such was the case for Great Britain, which has largely held onto the debt it incurred as far back as the Napoleonic wars.\n\nSo imagine you had a house with a 400k mortgage, but the interest was only 4k a year, or about $333 a month.  This is an *extremely* favorable loan.  You're living in a huge house... forever... for only $333 a month.  That's amazing.",

(this is the ultimate bad karma post but whatever)\n\n1. The US economy is growing faster than just about every other developed economy. We're the only ones with innovation. Examining GDP per capita growth rates, Europe (and Canada to a lesser extent) are going to be in the shitter very soon since they're not growing. If current growth trends continue, Europe will be third world in comparison to the US soon. [Our GDP per Capita is now double the EU's, and 52% higher than Canada. In 2008 it was 30% higher than the EU's and 4% higher than Canada's.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US-CA-EU)\n\n2. East Asia has a huge demographic crisis. China will have a big boom but is set to become Japan by the mid to late century since their population is aging. Our population pyramid isn't great but we're growing at least. \n\n3. The boomers dying off from old age in the next ~10-20 years will solve housing crises and cause a massive passdown of wealth.\n\n4. We have a very strong military, and a lot of our foreign adversaries are looking pretty weak right now. In the 50s-80s we were worried about the Soviets marching tanks to Paris, now they can't even make it 30 miles from home.",

That US benefitted of that for a time, but it's become clear that we are now more and more moving towards a multipolar world. And an increasingly unstable one at that.

Good analysis is looking at the stats, finding meaning within them, then deciding on your analysis of them.

Southern China (Shenzhen) near this region will be the ‘new economy’ region like how we think of California.  Singapore & Hong Kong will surpass NYC and Shenzhen will be a significant 3rd as primary financial centers.\n\nThis South China Sea region has a slightly growing population and as it becomes rich the vast (and growing) labor of India will be at its fingertips to kick off the next round of economic growth while the vast natural resources of Australia will be available to use. \n\nThe US military will increasingly seen domestically as an expensive subsidy that protects the rest of the world’s trade routes.  The US will pull back militarily & the world will become multi polar and economic regionalism will dominate.  The US will continue to dominate in the Americas and have the largest military but that advantage will become less relevant.",

I hear many people struggle to stay sane and motivated with social media blasting the life of the 1% traveling the world and living in 5-star hotels. Finally, Americans are unhealthy and fat as hell. This alone means a large part of our population is unfit for the military, not to mention the added costs to our entire economy from a sicker population. \n\nSo, I don't think we're really headed into a golden age.

Of course, it's one thing for the US to develop the latest models, and another to implement AI tools at scale, but here again I think the US is fairly well positioned (not least thanks to the federal system, which allows for internal experimentation as we're seeing in e.g. different states' policies on autonomous vehicles).",

I've met a few Americans last year who came to Germany and didn't regret it, because (in their own words) the quality of life is better. I also know a few people who have visited the US and all of them told me that they've never seen so much poverty in other western countries, the manifestations (in terms of rich and poor) are much more extreme than in Europe.

It’s the dysgenic mess of the global south. \n\nOne of the main reasons why Europe’s economy is suffering is because they allowed Washington way too much control of their politics and subsequently their economies. Washington basically sabotaged and crippled Europe with its warmongering foreign policy of the last 20+ years. Europe was getting cheap gas from Russia and had a good trading partner in Moscow. Washington put an end to that. \n\nEurope was fine before Washington decided to meddle in a heavy handed manner in the Middle East, creating refugee crises that have burdened Europe’s social safety nets which were clearly not designed to host millions of unproductive and hostile populations from culturally incompatible countries. \n\nYeah East Asia is experiencing demographic contraction. But they’re at least homogeneous and for the most part culturally sound. America’s population growth is almost solely due to third world immigration. Contrary to what the political establishment loves to say….its not “doctors and engineers” coming into the country. It’s future welfare cases that will only burden the commons to the breaking point. \n\nThe Endless Growth Cornucopians (mostly Jewish) like Pinker, Yglesias, Julian Simon, Herman Kahn & Jonah Goldberg like to cite the innovations of the 20th Century as proof that Mankind is the “Ultimate Resource”\nYeah, it was *European Men* that innovated in Euro-founded countries.\n\nNotice when these Panglossians cite the period 1880-1980 as proof that we can endlessly grow & innovate, that they neglect to mention that it was a specific people in specific cultures doing the innovating.  It’s NOT a universalist phenomenon.\n\nThis is why the post-1980 Libertarian dogma pushed by CATO, WSJ, John Stossel et al is such a scam. It conceals key facts about a century and projects out a perma-utopian future....despite the demographic conditions of the model century not being allowed to carry forward.\n\nIf the 1st world in general wants to have a sustainable and prosperous future they’ll do two things: \n\n1. Break from GAE (Global American Empire) and instill national/cultural pride and economic patriotism in their nations. If they sever their national cultures from the tentacles of the GloboHomo mega culture that permeates from Hollywood their nations and demographics will recover. They will heal. Culturally GAE has been a cancer on the world. It has pushed and promoted the most self-destructive behavior and values in history. \n\n2. Begin a large scale effort to sterilize the 3rd world. They are a massive burden on the 1st world. They constantly require aid and bailouts, which come at the expense of 1st world taxpayers. They often use the threat of unleashing mass migration as a blackmail tool if they don’t get their handouts in a timely manner. It’s best if they were reduced sizably in number via mass sterilization. \n\nYes the future can be bright for America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, East Asia and parts of Latin America. If those two goals are achieved. If not, then your “Turbo-America” dream will be crushed by the weight of Favelazation. Which will spread  a lot faster than you think once the demographic change from 1st world to 3rd world accelerates. See the difference between pre and post 1994 South Africa as a sobering example. From the only country in Africa with nuclear weapons to not being able to keep the lights on in just 30 years, one generation. Demographics are indeed destiny.",

The question of our time is what sort of character will our hegemonic presence take to frame our global stage? A story with a plot entering an act whose most crucial driving narrative value at stake is a slow mitosis separating autocracies from liberal democracies. We must lean into our representative democracy values. Rigid rule, unified rule, cannot ride the tiger of the next 50 years without either reifying into a corner of totalitarian stagnation, or collapse for another power to move in and seize more levers of power. Autocracy cannot avoid the temptation of a deep and cynical ultra-level of reality bending the possibilities of which we can only begin to imagine. 1984 with AI. We must be renewed in our primal blood oath to actual reality, to which only modern representative democracy is definitionally, and by its telos utterly one substance with, and bound to respond.

Currently there is a possibility that the world becomes multi-polar but it's really a hegemony as long as the US is willing to maintain that hegemonic power. The future is unwritten, there are plenty of people in the US that do not want the US to remain hegemonic. The more international crisis the more internal disagreement about all of this, the more miscalculations by the US the more hegemony is likely to fade. \n\nThe US also has its own demographic issues and subsidizing the population with immigrants to induce GDP growth and healthy population growth is not a consensus policy either. \n\nThere are a lot of technological changes that lead me to believe that energy production can and should become much cleaner in the coming decades. The population leveling off worldwide also makes it easier to feed everyone.  The adoption of new fuel sources that are more sustainable also makes things easier in the future. So I don't think there will be a resource crisis. \n\nIf the US maintains immigration and US hegemony, continues to lead the world in innovation and no catastrophic events happen then yes the US absolutely will be entering into another \"golden age\" but there are just so much unknowns and cracks in this mentality that leads to US hegemony and bleeding edge innovation seem to have cracks really obvious ones too. \n\nSo I guess it's a strong possibility OP is right, but also there is no guarantee that this happens in any way.

It’s the dysgenic mess of the global south. \n\nOne of the main reasons why Europe’s economy is suffering is because they allowed Washington way too much control of their politics and subsequently their economies. Washington basically sabotaged and crippled Europe with its warmongering foreign policy of the last 20+ years. Europe was getting cheap gas from Russia and had a good trading partner in Moscow. Washington put an end to that. \n\nEurope was fine before Washington decided to meddle in a heavy handed manner in the Middle East, creating refugee crises that have burdened Europe’s social safety nets which were clearly not designed to host millions of unproductive and hostile populations from culturally incompatible countries. \n\nYeah East Asia is experiencing demographic contraction. But they’re at least homogeneous and for the most part culturally sound. America’s population growth is almost solely due to third world immigration. Contrary to what the political establishment loves to say….its not “doctors and engineers” coming into the country. It’s future welfare cases that will only burden the commons to the breaking point. \n\nThe Endless Growth Cornucopians (mostly Jewish) like Pinker, Yglesias, Julian Simon, Herman Kahn & Jonah Goldberg like to cite the innovations of the 20th Century as proof that Mankind is the “Ultimate Resource”\nYeah, it was *European Men* that innovated in Euro-founded countries.\n\nNotice when these Panglossians cite the period 1880-1980 as proof that we can endlessly grow & innovate, that they neglect to mention that it was a specific people in specific cultures doing the innovating.  It’s NOT a universalist phenomenon.\n\nThis is why the post-1980 Libertarian dogma pushed by CATO, WSJ, John Stossel et al is such a scam. It conceals key facts about a century and projects out a perma-utopian future....despite the demographic conditions of the model century not being allowed to carry forward.\n\nIf the 1st world in general wants to have a sustainable and prosperous future they’ll do two things: \n\n1. Break from GAE (Global American Empire) and instill national/cultural pride and economic patriotism in their nations. If they sever their national cultures from the tentacles of the GloboHomo mega culture that permeates from Hollywood their nations and demographics will recover. They will heal. Culturally GAE has been a cancer on the world. It has pushed and promoted the most self-destructive behavior and values in history. \n\n2. Begin a large scale effort to sterilize the 3rd world. They are a massive burden on the 1st world. They constantly require aid and bailouts, which come at the expense of 1st world taxpayers. They often use the threat of unleashing mass migration as a blackmail tool if they don’t get their handouts in a timely manner. It’s best if they were reduced sizably in number via mass sterilization. \n\nYes the future can be bright for America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, East Asia and parts of Latin America. If those two goals are achieved. If not, then your “Turbo-America” dream will be crushed by the weight of Favelazation. Which will spread  a lot faster than you think once the demographic change from 1st world to 3rd world accelerates. See the difference between pre and post 1994 South Africa as a sobering example. From the only country in Africa with nuclear weapons to not being able to keep the lights on in just 30 years, one generation. Demographics are indeed destiny.",

It's what builds loyalty of new immigrants to the American dream and the concept of America.  It fosters unity and cohesion. It's why immigrants view immigrating to America differently than expating in the middle east or elsewhere  Nobody wants to be separated from their families.

It’s the dysgenic mess of the global south. \n\nOne of the main reasons why Europe’s economy is suffering is because they allowed Washington way too much control of their politics and subsequently their economies. Washington basically sabotaged and crippled Europe with its warmongering foreign policy of the last 20+ years. Europe was getting cheap gas from Russia and had a good trading partner in Moscow. Washington put an end to that. \n\nEurope was fine before Washington decided to meddle in a heavy handed manner in the Middle East, creating refugee crises that have burdened Europe’s social safety nets which were clearly not designed to host millions of unproductive and hostile populations from culturally incompatible countries. \n\nYeah East Asia is experiencing demographic contraction. But they’re at least homogeneous and for the most part culturally sound. America’s population growth is almost solely due to third world immigration. Contrary to what the political establishment loves to say….its not “doctors and engineers” coming into the country. It’s future welfare cases that will only burden the commons to the breaking point. \n\nThe Endless Growth Cornucopians (mostly Jewish) like Pinker, Yglesias, Julian Simon, Herman Kahn & Jonah Goldberg like to cite the innovations of the 20th Century as proof that Mankind is the “Ultimate Resource”\nYeah, it was *European Men* that innovated in Euro-founded countries.\n\nNotice when these Panglossians cite the period 1880-1980 as proof that we can endlessly grow & innovate, that they neglect to mention that it was a specific people in specific cultures doing the innovating.  It’s NOT a universalist phenomenon.\n\nThis is why the post-1980 Libertarian dogma pushed by CATO, WSJ, John Stossel et al is such a scam. It conceals key facts about a century and projects out a perma-utopian future....despite the demographic conditions of the model century not being allowed to carry forward.\n\nIf the 1st world in general wants to have a sustainable and prosperous future they’ll do two things: \n\n1. Break from GAE (Global American Empire) and instill national/cultural pride and economic patriotism in their nations. If they sever their national cultures from the tentacles of the GloboHomo mega culture that permeates from Hollywood their nations and demographics will recover. They will heal. Culturally GAE has been a cancer on the world. It has pushed and promoted the most self-destructive behavior and values in history. \n\n2. Begin a large scale effort to sterilize the 3rd world. They are a massive burden on the 1st world. They constantly require aid and bailouts, which come at the expense of 1st world taxpayers. They often use the threat of unleashing mass migration as a blackmail tool if they don’t get their handouts in a timely manner. It’s best if they were reduced sizably in number via mass sterilization. \n\nYes the future can be bright for America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, East Asia and parts of Latin America. If those two goals are achieved. If not, then your “Turbo-America” dream will be crushed by the weight of Favelazation. Which will spread  a lot faster than you think once the demographic change from 1st world to 3rd world accelerates. See the difference between pre and post 1994 South Africa as a sobering example. From the only country in Africa with nuclear weapons to not being able to keep the lights on in just 30 years, one generation. Demographics are indeed destiny.",

It’s the dysgenic mess of the global south. \n\nOne of the main reasons why Europe’s economy is suffering is because they allowed Washington way too much control of their politics and subsequently their economies. Washington basically sabotaged and crippled Europe with its warmongering foreign policy of the last 20+ years. Europe was getting cheap gas from Russia and had a good trading partner in Moscow. Washington put an end to that. \n\nEurope was fine before Washington decided to meddle in a heavy handed manner in the Middle East, creating refugee crises that have burdened Europe’s social safety nets which were clearly not designed to host millions of unproductive and hostile populations from culturally incompatible countries. \n\nYeah East Asia is experiencing demographic contraction. But they’re at least homogeneous and for the most part culturally sound. America’s population growth is almost solely due to third world immigration. Contrary to what the political establishment loves to say….its not “doctors and engineers” coming into the country. It’s future welfare cases that will only burden the commons to the breaking point. \n\nThe Endless Growth Cornucopians (mostly Jewish) like Pinker, Yglesias, Julian Simon, Herman Kahn & Jonah Goldberg like to cite the innovations of the 20th Century as proof that Mankind is the “Ultimate Resource”\nYeah, it was *European Men* that innovated in Euro-founded countries.\n\nNotice when these Panglossians cite the period 1880-1980 as proof that we can endlessly grow & innovate, that they neglect to mention that it was a specific people in specific cultures doing the innovating.  It’s NOT a universalist phenomenon.\n\nThis is why the post-1980 Libertarian dogma pushed by CATO, WSJ, John Stossel et al is such a scam. It conceals key facts about a century and projects out a perma-utopian future....despite the demographic conditions of the model century not being allowed to carry forward.\n\nIf the 1st world in general wants to have a sustainable and prosperous future they’ll do two things: \n\n1. Break from GAE (Global American Empire) and instill national/cultural pride and economic patriotism in their nations. If they sever their national cultures from the tentacles of the GloboHomo mega culture that permeates from Hollywood their nations and demographics will recover. They will heal. Culturally GAE has been a cancer on the world. It has pushed and promoted the most self-destructive behavior and values in history. \n\n2. Begin a large scale effort to sterilize the 3rd world. They are a massive burden on the 1st world. They constantly require aid and bailouts, which come at the expense of 1st world taxpayers. They often use the threat of unleashing mass migration as a blackmail tool if they don’t get their handouts in a timely manner. It’s best if they were reduced sizably in number via mass sterilization. \n\nYes the future can be bright for America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, East Asia and parts of Latin America. If those two goals are achieved. If not, then your “Turbo-America” dream will be crushed by the weight of Favelazation. Which will spread  a lot faster than you think once the demographic change from 1st world to 3rd world accelerates. See the difference between pre and post 1994 South Africa as a sobering example. From the only country in Africa with nuclear weapons to not being able to keep the lights on in just 30 years, one generation. Demographics are indeed destiny.",

The way to be successful on social media or for a news corporation is to get attention.  It's all a competition for attention and clicks.  Everything is competing for clicks and airtime.  The media companies that get the most airtime will make the most money and be the most successful businesses.  The media that doesn't get enough attention will eventually fail or drowned out by the more successful media companies.  It's how capitalism works.\n\nSo the next logical question is how do you get the most attention?  It isn't by providing long nuanced conversations about the issues.  It isn't an in depth discussion on how the economy works and why a policy is good or bad.  Humans have evolved to be very tribalistic creatures.  We crave to know we are the good tribe and that tribe over there is the bad tribe.  We get a dopamine rush when we are told who is causing the problems and who the evil people are.  We want simple easy to understand answers, no matter the complexity of the problem.  Naturally the media we consume will evolve to give us that.  Because capitalism in the media.  It is why we are becoming so polarized as a nation.  Look at how the tone has changed for every election.  Look at how Fox news has evolved over time.  Look at all the hate mongers getting larger platforms.  The basic reason why that happens is because news companies and politicians are competing for attention and that is the best way they can get it.  I'm not at all trying to say that this isn't a critical election for our future, because I think it is, but the media is amplifying everything to 11.\n\nNow to be clear a state run media system rather than a capitalistic one is on the opposite side of the pendulum and an even bigger problem IMO.  We don't want that.  But much like humans evolved to want to eat more food than they need, we evolved to crave bad news.  Capitalism will just promote whatever works the best until we build rules around it.  We need to find ways to promote less sensationalism and more media that is beneficial to our society.  idk the best way to do that but i recognize the problem which is step 1.",

If the US had not sunk so much money and production into China as well as offered to police their shipping lanes, as well as enforce the regional peace by throttling Japan's military and foreign policies, China would still be a 3rd world country, and their coast would have probably been conquered by Japan, or at the very least they'd have a sort of subservient position to Japan similar to a US/Mexico situation. \n\nChina has piss all resources and even worse geography for extracting/moving those resources. Their primary export was cheaper than slave labor, but that can only take you so far. Without continued outside assistance (of which they've pissed everyone off including their biggest paycheck the US)  their country can only rise to the level at which their labor force is cheaper than the next guy over. If companies could snap a finger and instantly move production facilities to India, other Asian countries, and Mexico, then China would already be in a very dire position. As it stands it will be slow decline over the next 10 years or so as companies very slowly and carefully pull out, and only towards the end of that 10 years will things really start to look scary for China.",

Is there a single period where the North and South agreed on anything? They've been bitterly opposed since even before independence.

In France, if you move to France and adopt French culture you will be considered French too, not matter the colour of your skin.\n\n Of course you have to adopt French culture.   But it isn’t as if the US is accepting of all cultures. You also have to learn English if you want to get high up in society(sure you can only speak Spanish if you’re in Miami and get by but the same can be said for Arabic in marseille, in both cases you won’t become president). \n\n America is more welcoming to migrants to come live in the US, that is true. But in France the migrants that do get accepted receive more solidarity from their fellow French in the form of eg public healthcare. In America citizenship doesn’t entitle you to that much. So you welcome more people, but the people you welcome are not given much. It’s just a different type of hospitality.\n\n For a large part of history Irish and Italian Catholics, Jews, were not considered full Americans. \nAmerican Tribalism between right wing and left wing is larger than in any other western country right now.",

The US also has a trade deficit with the EU, which means they sell more to Americans than vice-versa. So any end to trade (which is absurdly pessimistic) would hit Europe far more.\n\nLastly, exports are only 12% of US GDP. So American exports to the EU are about 2% of GDP. It’s about the equivalent of one lost year of GDP to completely end trade with the EU. Damaging, sure, but hardly apocalyptic, especially since the EU’s share of the global economy is expected to halve by 2050.\n\nAlso, strategic autonomy isn’t a threat. Washington wants to pivot to Asia-Pacific since that’s where the future of growth is. Europe is threatening us with a good time by taking care of its own affairs.",

And it gets even worse if you look at the non-voting population that leans even more heavily left.\n\n So you've got a state with a primarily left leaning population controlled by a legacy right leaning government that has arranged the system to hold onto power past their due date. While it's easy for the Reps to hold control of an apathetic and rigged government when they're issuing policies that most of the population doesn't actually care about, it would be much harder for Texas to lead any kind of civil war with a majority of their population opposed to it.

We are still a deeply flawed country that has made many mistakes. But with those mistakes, with those sins, comes the chance for redemption.\n\nHell, you could argue that our fate as a thriving, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural Democracy was decided because of something as evil as Slavery - from the very start, we had millions and millions of people who didn't look like European Settlers living among us.\n\nIf you want to look forward, I think that's the way to do so.

While immigration is around 400k per year (not counting illegal entries and students). Not to mention the quality of said migrants seems to have dropped precipitously.\n\nI hope y'all figure it out, seems completely messed up. Part of the problem is your population pyramid is so much more lopsided than America's, with a massive bulge of people aged 30-50 and a continuously shrinking group beneath them.

It's been over a decade now and what we see today is the children and grandchildren of those immigrants are almost indistinguishable from other Americans.. it takes a generation or two to assimilate and by the way there hasn't been any real issue with the original immigrants.

So 1 family would need 1 house, and maybe another for vacation. But real demand has 2 components: 1 what people need physically 2. what they think other people need and will need in future. Hence people invest on those items of believed value thus creating demand beyond the physical needs. In example of housing market the corporations invest in real estate because of the second component in the demand chain. Thus creating high price. And as it is with every bubble/overpriced commodity - the price will fall only when the belief of a value of that commodity will shift. And because this happens chaotically we basically never know when prices will fall. Especially if there are actors interested in keeping that belief going.",

I have had 2 American girlfriends from the us, one Caucasian from Tennessee and the other vietnamese-american from new Jersey. I have never dated a Mexican girl and I'm outwardly critical towards Mexico. It's easy to let your prejudice tell you what to think but it doesn't mean you can rely on it...

I encounter conversations about the U.S. whether I want to or not, and relying on a survey can't capture the full spectrum of attitudes that exist.

It's a relative issue and not an absolute one, America is not declining whatsoever.\n\nThe US remains the world's only military superpower. It has the world's largest economy and has, at WORST, incredibly positive relations with its peers aside from China. It is functionally the head of the G7 and NATO, has nearly achieved energy independence, is food-independent, and shares no borders with rivals. It remains the most technologically advanced country in the world with the most attractive employment opportunities for highly skilled foreigners.\n\nIt is true that there are valid concerns about the future of democracy as it has been practiced in the US, but the same or worse can be said about the power vacuums that will be left when Xi or Putin croak. Only the EU has more stable governance, and they've got more far right populists in their governments than they like to admit.\n\nThe only major US vulnerability is its reliance on Taiwan and South Korea for semiconductor production. Even then, all of the likely ways it would be threatened for America would also cause the same issues for their rivals.",

There’s a few reasons for this:\n\n1) The population difference between the US and other emerging superpowers. Both China and India have a billion people more than us, and the EU has more than 100 million. A country with 5% of the world population can’t be powerful enough to  reign in that other 95%, even if most of it is agnostic towards us. \n\n2) Completely ineffective leadership. The US really just had horrible, god awful leadership. Biden is a senile Chamberlain who’s administration lets Putin do whatever he wants Scot-free (yet Trump is the Russian asset lmao), and the Republicans are an actual cancer who is actively making the country worse and sabotaging American interests. The massive uprising against the US order lead by Russia, China, and Iran, is because it’s obvious our country simply cannot function anymore to project its interests. China has its problems, but it also has functional leadership. \n\n3) Failing legacy systems that allow the problems of point 2 to flourish. Our government was effectively designed to not function 300 years ago. But this isn’t a country of Jeffersonian farmers, we are a global superpower. And we only became one because we got lucky. Problem is even if we had good leadership (lol), the institutional problems are nearly impossible to fix without a fundamental constitutional overhaul. Our failing institutions will allow these problems to continue to exist. \n\nWhere will the US be in a few decades? We certainly won’t be the #1 Superpower but we will still be strong. My guess is that we will have our sphere of influence (Europe and North America), but we will be competing with China for it.",

Read a bunch of different authors, and then find the ones who actually make accurate predictions. George Freidman is a personal favorite if you can't tell, many of the general trends that he has written about have proved to be true. Biggest issue with Chip War is that it was released just after the CHIPS Act was passed. Much, if not all of the book was written before the bill was passed, so the impact of that legislation isn't factored in. Also the Inflation Reduction Act will be huge for bringing clean energy technology manufacturing to the US.\n\nI did say that I was nervous about political polarization and the impact of emerging technologies on disinformation, so I'm not sure where your last paragraph is coming from. Seems like a mischaracterization of what I said. But I could flip that around on you and just point out that history is full of doomsdayers too, and yet we just keep getting better as a society. Also, we continue to see YoY growth in high school and college graduation rates, so I'm not sure where you're seeing us move away from education as a society.\n\nBut I'd be curious to hear your predictions.

In the 1970s the trend was that Argentina, Venezuela and Chile would all surpass Western Europe in GDP per capita and average incomes by the year 2000. In the year 2000 analysts were predicting that Brazil and Russia would have economies as large as Japan by 2020, and of course back in the 1980s analysts were predicting that Japan could surpass the USA in total GDP by the year 2000. \n\nIt is not possible to make any sort of reasonable prediction over 100 years and it is hard to even make ones over 25 years.",

The advent of the TV and the radio meant we started getting all our news from only 3 or 4 channels.  That greatly reduced polarization because the goal was to appeal to as many as possible rather than a political party.  Along came cable news in the 90s and things have been trending in the wrong direction ever since when the media started trying to appeal to a political base rather than everyone.\n\nHowever we have had social justice movements and polarization all throughout the 20th century.  I didn't live through the Vietnam War or the race riots or McCarthyism but I imagine things were very extreme back then as well.  I know if you ask some of the older generations alive today, they say the world has always been like this.\n\nThe difference is now news and propaganda and click bait reach us faster than ever and we are more connected than ever.

Anyone such as yourself who thinks they are comparable is a fool. There are far too many systemic and historical differences between the two for any comparison to be at all helpful. We live in a fundamentally different world than the Romans did. \n\nPeople have been complaining about the eroding of norms and traditions for hundreds of years.  Abraham Lincoln and FDR, two of America's greatest presidents, did undemocratic things while in office. Richard Nixon did a lot of damage to American democracy, but we survived that just fine. The reality is that political systems fail when they no longer provide security, and don't enable people to gain prosperity and better their lives. The United States is currently richer than it has ever been. The average American citizen is better off now financially and more free politically than any Americans ever have been in history. All of our major rivals have headwinds facing them that are just as strong or are much stronger than ours are. \n\nMark my words, the 21st century will almost certainly not see the collapse of the American democratic system, and America will continue to be first among equals in the grand scheme of geopolitics.",

The facts are nowhere close to defeat, we are doing better in a lot of metrics than previous \"worst\" moments. We are doing better than what we suffered during the world wars. Yet the courage and fighting spirit and the faith in the future of people is what is sapped and depleted.\n\nThis last part is not just a US thing. It is present throughout all of western Europe as well.\n\nPS: Actually our politics is thoroughly captured and paralyzed by the rich which is similar to the late 1800s.
