I also expect several attempts-- again, with varying successes-- to ban no-fault divorce, or at least to \"give it back to the states.\"* I expect that at least some states will ban certain forms of birth control (IUDs, Nexplanon, potentially the pill). Women's travel would also have to be curtailed or monitored to prevent women from crossing state lines to obtain reproductive care-- be that abortion or an IUD placement-- as many states are already attempting to do.\n\nIt is not that much of a mystery what they want to do. They're very clear about it. We don't have to speculate that much. The only thing to really speculate about is whether they will be successful in their endeavors.\n\nSorry for all the em dashes.\n\n*EDIT: my bad, divorce laws are already with the states-- see this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1e447os/how_do_you_think_womens_rights_will_be_changed_if/ldcojfd/",

As soon as I got home, my mom put me in the car and drove me back to the bank to tell on me. I have a gender neutral name, and my mom was sure they'd made a mistake and thought I was a boy. In her defense, I did have very short hair and dressed in jeans and T-shirts. Also in her defense, women weren't allowed to have bank accounts! The law had changed, and my mom didn't know because she didn't watch the news or read the paper. I knew, because of Civics class (which they don't teach at my old school anymore).\n\nWhen my young aunt got pregnant, she went to live at a home for unwed mothers until she gave birth and gave the baby up for adoption. She had no choice. I remember when birth control pills were finally approved for public use. My aunt went doctor shopping until she found one who would prescribe them for her, an unmarried woman. At the time, only married women who already had a bunch of children were permitted to use the birth control pill and only if it were dangerous for them to get pregnant again. My mom only had three kids, so she didn't qualify until she had two more and nearly died with the last one. \n\nMy mom was fired from her job when she got pregnant with me. She hid it as long as she could, but someone told on her and she lost her job. When her friend Bridget was raped at work by her boss, Bridget lost her job for reasons that are still unclear to me. Because she fought back? Because she didn't fight back hard enough? I never knew, and I don't think I ever will. I do know that she had a baby out of wedlock and had to get her dad to co-sign a mortgage for the house she bought and paid for and fixed up all by herself. She couldn't get an office job, though, so she got a job as an after-hours cleaner. \n\nThat's how I think women's rights will be changed if Trump wins. We'll go back to women having no financial means and no right to own the bodies they live in. I'm taking this election very seriously because I've already lived through the consequences of losing it.",

Even if that bullet has blown his brains out, it wouldn't have stopped. There are too many nutjobs in every level of government at this point. \n\nEveryone, make sure that you're not just voting in national elections. It's important to also be aware of and active in state and local politics. Stay educated about candidates and what they stand for. Don't be like Trumpers who are literally in a cult and will vote Republican even if a rabid badger is running. Also vote for harm reduction, even when there aren't any good choices on the ballot. I strongly dislike Biden, but I'm going to vote for him because he is leagues better than Trump. Third party never wins; I hate it, but the stakes are high and voting for principles isn't going to keep you safe. Change takes time, and it takes some long-term strategizing.

The advent of birth control completely shifted the power balance between men and women, and enabled women to be more than just incubators.  Blocking access to birth control is the quickest way to control women, and controlling women is key to far-right strategy. \n\n\nThey’ve already started gutting DEI programs, so I wouldn’t be surprised if they start targeting anti-discrimination laws as well. Due to this, I expect to see less women in positions of power in red states. Mothers and pregnant women, especially those who work, will be affected by this shift. Without anti-discrimination laws, corporations will lose their incentive to hire women, especially pregnant women or women who may become pregnant. Combine that with reduced access to birth control and abortion and you’ve got yourself a Margaret Atwood style dystopia, presto! \n\n\nI’m getting out of Texas regardless, but I’d encourage women living in red states to start coming up with contingency plans. Come up with a long-term exit strategy, a short-term exit strategy, and contingency plans in case of an unwanted pregnancy or other unforeseen life events. You might think it’ll never happen to you, but we’re all at risk. In Texas, you can’t get an abortion even in cases of rape. Things will certainly get worse before they get better.\n\n\nEDIT: oh, and how could I forget to mention divorce laws? I expect to see less alimony, less child support, and less prosecution for marital rape or abuse. Incels and other “men’s rights activists” types have been on this train for forever. First, you control a woman’s body through regressive abortion and reproductive health care laws, then you limit her ability to be independent by removing protections for women in the workforce, and finally, you make it difficult (if not impossible) to remove herself from a male partner, trapping her in a potentially dangerous situation and killing her spirit.",

Fl Senator Rick Scott has a plan that includes sunsetting all federal laws five years after they are enacted unless Congress passes them again. So if his plan ever passes all the equality laws that are more than five years old will simply end—unless they are passed again. In light of the current political scene, what do you think will happen?",

She's not denying the impact of age on Biden or Trump.\n\nSpecifically which of the following will be ALLOWED in the United States \n-- abortion. What further abortion restrictions are pretty well guaranteed?\n-- Woman's studies in universities? Will these be defunded?\n-- Will African-American studies be defunded?\n-- What other theocratic laws will Trump and his Republican Congress\n\nThe only way to disprove my claims if for Democrats to unite. As AOC ultimately says, they are afraid and the forces are going to dismantle the entire ticket, putting them at risk of lawsuits \n\nTrump is DOUBLING down.

The 2020 election was won by just 4% of the total votes cast. Truth is both sides basically stand for the same basic beliefs, with minor differences here and there. Hence, they get basically the same number of votes.\n\nHarris likes to claim that she'll make the US a better place (despite currently being in office). And Trump likes to claim he'll make america great again (despite previously being in office). \n\nBoth sides claim that this is the most important election in history (dont forget they claimed this in 2020, 2016, and 2012). Truth is, you're not gonna see a major difference between a Trump vs. Harris presidency. The US didn't become a socialist hellhole after the 2020 election, and the US didn't ban gay people after the 2016 election. It's just two wealthy individuals, being funded by wealthy parties, trying to run a country for 4 more years.",

That may have an impact on conferences and other tourist related events. It also may create issues in air travel as Dallas is a huge hub for multiple airlines.\n\nIt already appears that a portion of women who can are choosing to move to places where their reproductive freedoms are less curtailed. And that creates a brain drain on states like Texas which aren’t exactly bastions of the intelligentsia. Same deal with people who grasp that climate change is real leaving Florida. Businesses appear to be hesitant to open offices in places where women may be reluctant to turn up, or where their staff may drop in productivity due to forced pregnancies. \n\nWhile that may be a boon to states already absorbing more net intra-national immigration, that puts downward pressure on wages, upward pressure on housing, and creates a myriad of other issues in those states. \n\nNationally, that also creates issues for the tax base. The states that take more than their per capita share of National taxes already skew red, but this will likely make the problems more extreme. And taxing wealthier states to support failing red states will add to the current tensions, and will put a burden on those economies.",

I won’t be trapped here. \n\n\nI have hope that deep blue states will refuse to cooperate with a national ban on abortion or any repeal of civil rights. Blue states already defy national law by legalizing marijuana, and they know their populace will revolt if abortion is banned or other regressive laws are adopted. \n\n\nThat said, I’m still planning to move close to a border in case I need to flee the country tbh. Maybe that sounds paranoid, but I’d rather be paranoid than trapped. Not to compare the USA to nazi Germany (because overall they’re very different), but I’m sure the Jews who escaped before the ghettos were locked down also seemed paranoid to their peers.",

Sounds reasonable, right? After all, the states should be in charge of themselves. Until you realize that many states want to revert back to white, male, landowners only voting. Since it is the belief of the evangelical right that women should be required to stay home and raise babies, they will strip voting rights as well as the ability to work outside of the home.\n\nFurther, they believe the federal government overstepped when they passed the civil rights bill, giving minorities equal accessibility to things like housing, medical care, voting, etc. They believe that they should not have equal rights forced on them. Instead, they should be allowed to discriminate against whomever they choose. Part of the civil rights act covers LGTBQ rights as well. Conservatives do not believe that anyone who falls in this category should be allowed to exist. All LGTBQ people will be stripped of their rights.\n\nI know people think we are being hyperbolic, but we are witnessing some of this playing out today. States are either banning abortion altogether or severely limiting it. Many states do not have and will not have any exceptions to this, including to protect the life of the mother. Texas, for one, has tried to pass a law that any woman who used public roads to access abortion could be prosecuted. Texas also has a law that states if a woman has an abortion, she can be sued by anyone who wants to bring a suit against her. Some of those laws were deemed unconstitutional, but that could change given the right courts.",

Depending on the pill, that may not apply (for example, progestin-only pills, which thin the lining of your uterus, would probably be banned, but ones that interfere with ovulation would not). Many \"pro-life\" activists also push for the recognition of fertilized eggs/fetuses as full legal persons under the law (\"life begins at conception\"), so not allowing the fertilized egg to implant in the uterine wall would be murder. Plan B would also swiftly become illegal-- some particularly low-information or high-agenda \"pro-life\" activists just call it \"the abortion pill\" (even though \"the abortion pill\" is something very different).",

Epstein and Company which was founded for exclusively  $1B+ clients but no one could ever say who they were. Probably because they were Russian oligarchs who were in the process of stealing $1.4T worth of perestroika money from Russian grandmas with a stopover in Israel on the way to Brighton Beach. \n\n•Epstein learned and understood the neurosis of “poor little rich kids” because he taught them all at Dalton.  He probably knew more about the dysfunctional families of Wall Street than their therapists did.\n\n•Vicky ward (vanity fair) dug into Epsteins  finances with her article\n\n•Epstein was “bounty hunting” (his words) money lost to fraud because he knew the fraud networks by then because he worked for/with them. It was easy money double billing.\n\n•1989 Epstein becomes friends with Wexner who is effectively the head of the Zionist mob who would unexplainably sign over power of attorney for his entire fortune to Epstein in 91.\n\n•1991 Kolomoiksiy starts Privatbank in Ukraine to cater to the same oligarchs needing to move money from the former Soviet Union to Cyprus \nhttps://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/oligarchs-weaponized-cyprus-eranch-of-ukraines-largest-bank-to-send-5-billion-abroad\n\n•Towers financial was a debt collection company cover for a Ponzi scheme\n\n•Epstein was originally hired there as a consultant\n\n•Hoffenberg (towers principal) says it was all Epstein doing the Ponzi scheme\n\n•UK’s Prince Andrew’s parties were all young (bizarrely dressed) Russian models\n\nThis was a couple years before the Russian model Ruslana Korshunova’s death.

About $60,000 was spent on a trip to Russia in 1997 for Tom DeLay, Buckham, and Abramoff. In 1998, $1 million was sent to Buckham via his organization U.S. Family Network to \"influence DeLay's vote in 1998 on legislation that helped make it possible for the International Monetary Fund to bail out the faltering Russian economy\". DeLay voted for the legislation. The money was funneled through the Dutch company Voor Huisen, the Bahamas company Chelsea Enterprises, and the London law firm James & Sarch Co.[46][47] The executives involved, who met DeLay during the 1997 trip, were Marina Nevskaya and Alexander Koulakovsky. Nevskaya was also involved in Abramoff's support of an Israeli military academy, according to an email sent to Abramoff.[48]",

Wade, a number of women have been prosecuted in the United States for self-inducing abortion under a variety of state statutes, ranging from fetal homicide to failure to report an abortion to the coroner. Recently, the issue has gained greater attention because of several well-publicized cases in which women were prosecuted—and even imprisoned—for self-inducing an abortion or being suspected of doing so. Despite claims from antiabortion advocates and lawmakers that abortion restrictions are intended to only criminalize providers of abortion care, some prosecutors have exercised their discretion under current state laws to penalize women who end their pregnancies on their own. Moreover, these laws are even being used to pursue women who are merely suspected of having self-induced an abortion, but in fact had suffered miscarriages.\n\nThere's more at this link: https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2015/09/prosecuting-women-self-inducing-abortion-counterproductive-and-lacking-compassion",

Likely widespread looting and rioting in blue cities and local farming communities with their own militias popping up in rural areas. \n\nThere's also likely going to be an even bigger military recruitment problem as more and more people wake up to the reality of the USA creating or getting involved in wars and not wanting any part of them as the quality of living and chances of property and prosperity are being rapidly diminished.\n\nGun sales have been rocketing up since 2020 so there's definitely something in the air so I'd start prepping for self reliance because if shit goes down the govt ain't gonna be able to handle everything everywhere all at once.",

There’s 3 things that are needed in order for the civil war to occur:\n1.) conditions \n2.) leadership and organization\n3.) funding\n\n1.) conditions: a population that is comfortable, fed, and lives with thrice the luxury and opulence of medieval kings is not a population that revolts. Modern day humans by and large choose comfort and security over hardship and disruptions in their own little bubbles of reality. This is why you see predominantly “emotional based” pandering by politicians and voting based upon the same mindset. It feels good therefore it must be the right way. War is literally hell on earth. It would mean the disruption of electricity, sources of food, water, economics, everything that everyone takes for granted as part of “normal society”.  Society is just too complacent and weak for that anymore. I guarantee you that a large number of people will vote for kamala simply bc their favorite pop star is as well. Americans don’t want responsibility for their own lives. They just want to be fed, housed, have money, and blow it on material possessions while they use the internet for a sense of self worth. \n\n2.) Leadership and Organization: successful military campaigns rely on cohesion, training, planning, and a hierarchy amongst those that conduct the fighting. Who, in the modern day, has the support, the platform, the charisma, and the love of enough people who are willing to give up their comfortable safe lives in exchange for a ruck and a rifle to fight someone else’s war? We live in a time and a country without heroes. There are no George Washingtons, no Brigham Youngs, No Lee, no McArthurs, no Pattons. \n\n\n3.) Funding: in an overwhelming majority of historical precedence, the sitting government wins against guerrilla insurgents. The exceptions being when those guerrillas have support of industrial nations abroad. War is incredibly expensive. It requires Men, the resources to feed, train, equip, transport, and maintain them. The sitting government has all of that at their disposal, and the power of media and propaganda at its disposal. Insurgencies rely on a “death by a thousand cuts” approach. This often becomes multi generational, with the inevitable goal of making their opponents willingness to fight them too unpopular and too costly to continue. In 20 years of occupation in Afghanistan, the coalition killed an estimated 96k enemy combatants, while only losing a few thousand. Of the few thousand the coalition lost, 96% were not due to small arms fire. Entire male blood lines of Afghan tribesmen were lost fighting us, but inevitably they won. This is not due to battlefield victory, but due to making continued occupation too expensive to maintain. All the while they had several international networks of Arms dealers and volunteer fighters consistently supplying them.",

If he wins there will be rebels against project 2025. That's a guarantee. And I will be one of those ppl. Trump just being involved in politics has made our country do divided. And it gets worse everyday. This Trump is outnfor revenge and thats all. So no matter who wins this it is going to be a different America for atleast the first year. We will see less chaos under Harris overall but McDonald Trump and his cult followers will definitely cause chaos if he loses 100%. But no matter what there is already a silent war and it gets worse everyday. The sad fact that I watch videos of early voters and it looks almost like it's black vs white. I didn't think it would be this way but I saw videos of early black voters ALLL for Harris. They even brought a marching band! And then i saw ppl voting for trump and they were ALLLLL whote ppl. So the media doesn't show this stuff bc right away it would make.black undecided voters definitely sway more to Harris for sure. But there is already a war especially on social media. Trump ruined friendships bc of politics. We never saw so many friendships ruined over politics as much as in 2024. And it's bc of that cult mentality. These ppl will choose Trump over their best friends. It's sad af. But u know if Trump loses there will be a war or some kind of war that will definitely be physical bc MAGA doesnt know how to accept defeat and they are much more angry now than 2020 for sure. So this is 10x more heated than 2020. And even that was a disaster.  Which they are still talking about. So imagine whats going to happen this time if they dont get their way. I truly do believe that the turmoil already caused so much separation that no matter who wins we will definitely see some sort of conflict. But MAGA is not tough enough to win a war verse America. If Trump loses and MAGA tries to start a war they will get defeated immediately and we will never see Trump or MAGA ever again. But if he wins you will DEFINITELY see ALOT of rebels. And I myself will be one that will NOT follow any project 2025 laws. That's my take.",

There were real repercussions for participating in January 6th and the lives of people who participated were destroyed- jobs lost, doing time, paying fines....many have regretted it because they lack the financial cushion of their leader and when the Feds makes you life difficult you don't have the resources to deal with it.\n\nInstead, if Trump wins there will be more violence, like there was when he was in office -many hate crimes like the mass shootings at the synagogue and in san antonio and the nazi march in charlottesville. Trump gives his base permission to behave this way and actively encourages it. The most sure way to deter violence is to not have him back in office. Trump has talked about rounding people up who criticize him and not just undocumented immigrants. Trump and his supporters are not the smartest people, so their lack of planning will result in chaos and even more harm.\n\nThis is not comparable to what was happening in Ireland where people had a legitimate gripe rooted in a deep history of British occupation in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Trump supporters are cultists, not idealogues. They are conspiracy theorists, not policy wonks. They are against things- trans people, women's rights, black people, immigrants, but they are not FOR anything. You can't fight if you don't know what you are fighting for and this group is clueless. They just \"want\" Trump because they hate so much but not because they love anything in particular. Trump has not promised or offered a way to improve their lives because their lives are not Trump's priority.",

Muslim enclaves wreaking havoc across the face of The Continent.  I believe the Brits wish they had access to firearms.  US citizens want to be left alone unencumbered by what has become a ruling class essentially.  The liberals want absolute control in every aspect of life.  They have stretched the bounds of sanity in recent years.  Ultra left wing groups destroyed the Democratic Party.  Believing that a leftwing government as now constituted would not order the military on its own people is fallacious reasoning.  Statements made by Democratic politicians and their surrogates are pretty supportive of such actions. A recent change to military regulations made by the Biden Administration opened the door to shoot American citizens.  This is against existing laws and bureaucratic sleight of hand does not change it.  Would the military act on such orders is questionable the Obama administration removed officers with conservative views forcing them out.  As for rank and file soldiers firing on their own families and friends questionable.  Many military personnel are conservatives.  It might not bode well for leftwing officers directing such activities.  As it is currently written you as a soldier are legally bound to disregard illegal orders under the Uniform Code Of Military Justice.  Depending on who would win such activities could put you in jail.  America is rife with former combat experienced citizens.  Honed on some of the bloodiest battlefields of the 20th and 21st centuries we are wholly capable of fighting using small unit tactics to hamstring larger forces.  We have many groups of para military here. Some are known by the government agencies many the best and most organized are not.  With US agencies now populated by the left and being used against conservative Americans we now see those things as being actionable.  We will not accept tyranny from our own government.  The left has erupted with a new form of insanity disregarding structure and purpose replacing it with emotional responses and hysterical decision making.  As President Lincoln said and to paraphrase, the United States would never fall to an outside enemy but would fall from within.  He was right.",

You can research the reasons our first Civil War occurred among other Civil War's in other countries then look at today's political landscape, society's regression and U.S debt ceiling. We owe our greatest adversary more money then we'd ever be able to pay off. China. The current Federal Government is not admired or respected by China or other threats! The entire world is sitting at the edge of a bottomless pit. Some would argue if we had a Civil War breakout in the U.S. the military would stand by their oath to defend the Constitution and who pays them...the Federal Government. The Federal Government is technically bankrupt if a Civil War breaks out. U.S. currency would most definately crash, thus, who can pay professional soldiers? Let's use the RedState-BlueState theory to answer that question: RedState's are more financially stable in a cash crunch and there is more money in various currency among Republican/Conservative personnel, agricultural integrity and statistics show they have the most firearms among their citizens. BlueState officials don't manage money well to say the least. RedState's sit on our country's most vital resources. The Fed has been banning drilling and the Fed has spent most their reserves. The matter of paying people wouldn't be a reason anyone stayed to defend the Federal Government in a Civil War. Oaths wpuld be worthless in a divided country under Civil War. We can't consider ports a plus for BlueState's these days either. Some of the largest ports accessing the Atlantic are in Red supporting State's, including Naval bases. The Atlantic would serve the most important access in a Civil War. Why? We go back to the debt owed China. China is on the Pacific side and China would most likely support the RedState-cause as a chance to recoup some debt and further destabilize the current Government. So the Pacific Coast would be sitting in the line of sight of China...a Civil War doesn't mean it will just be fought by American citizens. Let's not forget 65%+ of our current military tends to lean Red. Don't let the media in today's world make you think otherwise. Every state has its own well equipped National Guard, then there is the case for the active duty military splitting up and important military bases are in the majority of Red supporting states. OK. Enough of that scenario. Don't worry about any of that because the actual chance of this regardless is 15%. There would be nothing left if a Civil War kicked off in this country. Things are not THAT unstable yet, even under the current landscape. Let's go with the higher probability of pockets of violence throughout the country.  There are 2 groups of radical supporters...MAGA and ANTIFA. You'd most likely see fighting between the 2 groups. Even normal Republicans and Democrats aren't going to allow another insurrection by ANYONE. The active duty military won't be involved in small pockets of violence and we could even claim those pockets would be more like rioting then anything. Police. National Guard. They'd squash those problems fairly quick. Those problems (as proven) would most likely occur in BlueState cities, not even outlying towns. There's not going to be an open rebellion among State's. My theory is my theory from experience and understanding of history and military experience. What we all need to remember is we are all American citizens and in the end, not even the active duty service is trained or brainwashed to kill fellow citizens on our home soil and there's still not even individuals radical enough to kick off a nationwide rebellion...not even Donald Trump or Joe Biden. Kamala Harris isn't going to raise enough problems to start a war either if she's elected. What is very possible, is not a Civil War, but a larger worldwide conflict! You should be smart enough to realize if that happens, we as Americans (as always) come together for a common cause. Prove me wrong. Personally? Maybe we've all become to complicit to our freedoms. Maybe a worldwide conflict is something we all need (as much as I hate to say that) to bring everyone down a notch. The real enemy is not our own Government or citizens on either side the isle. There's a far more serious threat to all of us out there. ",

I guess the questions the Government needs to ask is, is the greed worth it? can I survive it? Is it going to be worth it, if I do survive it? And is there going to be enough of America left to make it all worth while? Because all the greedy money I gained is going to be gone rebuilding!",

I have faith in the US Citzens who are the US Military and the one route this nation has to recover the nation back to The People is for the military to stand down and stand up against tierney which is and has been what The People have been suffering under democrats rule.    Most legal citizens are already used to barely eating and being homeless and being denied help from the government as they choose to help noncitizens above citizens for years now... the job pool is  full again noncitizens being prioritized over citizens for employment.   If this continues the nation will collapse and at best citizens will have to exodus the US and hope for a sustainable life elsewhere because life for a US citizen is simply near unsustainable.. we all see how this current government moves and when it is all said and done if they win there will just be millions of noncitizens thrown out in the trash with the citizens as they will have served their purpose as they are going to be allowed to vote and once they fulfill this contract they were given by this current rule will become worthless just like citizens everything will be taken from them they will receive no more payments they will be made to start paying their own phone bills and rents and they may have a bit better chance as noncitizens are prioritized in the workplace and usurp citizens as top priority to hire.  There is only one hope and that is for the opposing party to win and show what they can do to turn around this nearly collapsed nation and prove they  too are not just tyrants, there is no doubt the current party is absolute tyrants and wish to create a communist US, no I dont see our military soldiers standing for this. If our option now is obey or suffer and die then the results of Civil War will not be any different from the circumstances we are and have been facing throughout this rulership.",

There is significant support for white Christian nationalism on one side, and only one side. It has infiltrated every level of conservatism not only in the US, but across Western Europe. Support for fascism is rising. Hell, Marie le Pen was found to be *legally a fascist.* You can argue that the 'powers that be' pushed a desperate poor and middle class to this point, but those people have turned to something beyond their control or understanding. It isn't going away. If you think that we should raise taxes and implement single payer and be more lax on immigration, and I think the United States should be a white Christian ethnostate, not only are we not on the same side, I am so deeply entrenched in my delusions that the powers that got me into this mess are now largely powerless to get me out of it.",

The right seem like the side more likely to start a war (e.g. if Trump gets assassinated), but the problem is that they are not a unified group. America First extremists like Fuentes have started to turn against Trump and the Neocons have hated the fact that they have to entertain Trump/MAGA as a legitimate faction of the party from the start. Have read quite a few QAnon threads on numerous websites and they largely just turn into jumbled circlejerks of commotion, everyone getting hyped from the energy but they always descent into dogpiling on the moderates and mudslinging if people aren't \"extreme enough\". So I'd largely say they have the desire but maybe not the ability to start a civil war.\n\nOn the other hand, the left seems to be far more accepting of each other BUT seems to have fairly violent/extreme rhetoric towards the right specifically. Extremist views range from calling for the reduction in funding for, all the way to the abolishment of the police force. Considering the unification within the party - they have the ability to start a civil war but probably not the desire.\n\nBut then again, America has always been a pretty extreme and wacky nation. To have the right to bare fully-automatic assault rifles in your constitution is wild enough in itself. The fact that every couple of years you guys have a financial crisis because someone decided to deregulate the economy too much is also a laugh and a half. Yet it continues to be the wealthiest and most powerful nation on the  planet.",

It's worth it, I promise.\n\nIt's been years since I listened to it, but here's my best recollection:\n\n* The situation in the US is (or was at the time) very similar to other countries in the years before they had a civil war. That doesn't mean there will be a civil war, but it's definitely worrying.\n\n* We have real-world evidence that it is possible for US citizens to fight their own government. Anyone who tells you \"a civil war isn't possible because the US military is too powerful\" is mistaken.\n\n* The US would probably split into dozens of factions. State governments might declare independence, but also, there are lots of separatist groups across the US with considerable numbers who are just waiting for the moment when federal power starts to flicker.\n\n* There is a very good chance the US military would also split into factions, depending on who's in charge at the time. During Trump's presidency, there were a number of high-ranking personnel who essentially decided they would disobey if he tried to command them to fight against US citizens on US soil.\n\n* While the federal government has a lot of firepower and a lot of personnel, they would be trying to stamp out lots of rebellions by lots of different, disparate, uncoordinated groups, and their logistical resources would be stretched pretty thin.\n\n* Urban warfare is really, really hard. Even for a powerful military. Cities would be difficult for anyone to capture and maintain, including the federal government.\n\n* There would probably be disruption of basic necessities. Water, power, gas, etc. Our infrastructure is extremely vulnerable. If you live in a place where you depend on these things to survive, you're gonna have a bad time.\n\n* Victory would not be determined by who has the most guns. Lots of civil war preppers, gun enthusiasts, etc. would actually be outmatched by untrained urban hooligans. We've seen this in other modern civil wars. So your best bet for survival is not to buy guns and spend time at the range, but to learn medicine and figure out how to quickly and secretly navigate your local area.",

And remember, the majority of states ARE red, with all the resources they’d need. \n\nThe people in this post talk about unrest… who are you talking about here? Conservatives are very tolerant to put up with the liberalism that has plagued our country for too long. Considering California just basically confirmed they allow illegals to vote by making it illegal to check id, I would be surprised if they didn’t ORGANIZE a war. Only the liberals go around burning shit down, like Taco Bell’s and play it again sports. Conservatives don’t fuck around. \n\nIt’s not going to be like the UK. I personally wouldn’t partake unless it was organized by states and the time was taken to select good leadership. I don’t think leaders would be in a rush. I’ll say, if Kamala and you dumb ass liberals think you can abuse our laws, and the future of our cherished land for any longer, you’re wrong. \n\nAnd I’m not over here in a militia or anything, I can just see the writing on the wall. By the way guy saying Christian nationalism has taken over? Please, this is a Christian nation. People say those of you who turn away from God end up worshiping the first thing you can as an alternative. We’ve clearly seen it play out now in the woke religion. Laughable really. ",

Like, we all know about the civil wars towards the end of the republic and even in the late-middle empire (think Caesar vs Pompey, the crisis of the 3rd century, Constantine vs Maxentius. During all of these conflicts, the Romans killed many of each other. However, they still had such a large pool of manpower to draw on that as late as the latter 300’s they were still crossing the Rhine to project power into Germany, and were pushing deep into Persian territory. \n\nThe problem was, the population just kept declining with the various plagues that hit the empire, while those across the border weren’t affected (Germanic population went up from the second century to the fifth, while the Roman population declined). This is why Rome finally fell in the 400’s, because only then could it no longer afford the cost in men to fight both itself and those on it’s perifery. \n\nSo what I’m saying is, the American Empire is gonna maintain its hegemony for the rest of our lives if things continue the way they are. We can fight each other all we want, but we’ll still be on top. Our birthrate stays increasing (thanks to immigration), while both the Chinese and Russian birthrates are abysmally low in comparison (under replacement level). \n\nTl,dr: The US to Rome comparison doesn’t work too well, seeing as Rome fell mainly because its population decreased drastically compared to its enemies. On the other hand, the US population keeps increasing in comparison to the populations of its “enemies”. Therefore, the US isn’t gonna pull a Rome, unless we get hit with some ((very high death rate)) plagues of our own. \n\nSide note: I really need to stop procrastinating and do my postlab",

Like statistically it is near 100% certainly either a Democrat or Republican will win. These parties know this, it isn't a secret. So just putting a background here, this is why many people think third parties aren't serious parties.\n\nBut the Green Party has no real plans or strategy to do anything outside the Presidential Election every 4 years. They don't try to win city/state seats in left-leaning communities in the US or seek to create a starting point for their party. If they were more successful or obviously trying to start a local swell of support, they might be taken more seriously.\n\nA popular thought is that the Green Party has achieved only TWO things in the past 30 years: Getting Bush elected in 2000 and getting Trump elected in 2016. Both of their achievements directly hurt their own cause.\n\nAdditionally, the Green Party has previously received money and support from the Republican Party, leading many people to jump on the \"spoiler\" bandwagon.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/general-news-65e9d5d001dfd10c86ca9ab37e53e159\n\nhttps://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/img-src-images-santorum1-jpg-hspace-5-vspace-5-align-left-gop-donors-funded-entire-pa-green-party-drive\n\nhttps://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/14/green-party-lawyers-have-ties-gop-counties-association/5791100002/",

She has no legislative power at all. Even if her ideas were good, why would we expect the other parties to just put aside everything they believe in and pass the laws Stein asks them to pass? They don't do that for their *own* party. Why would they do that for Green?\n\nIt's bad to vote for Green because they very literally aren't a real political party. Political parties aren't just guys at the top talking about their personal beliefs. Political parties are groups of people united in working towards a set of common goals and principles, spread across all levels of society and government. No matter how much you like Jill Stein personally, she doesn't have a party to back her. Voting for her is as good an idea as voting for your neighbor Gary, or me, or your cat--even if we work with the assumption that she is going to win.\n\nIf the Green Party was anything more than an absolute scam trying to rook vulnerable people out of their political donations, then they wouldn't run for President at all. They'd instead work to build up a political party by connecting with voters at a grassroots level, as they start to find potential candidates for office. That's what the Green Party does in other countries.

The largest electoral group in the US is... you guessed it... non-voters. More likely than not, the lion's share of green voters would simply not be voting at all, or would be voting for any other fringe party out there. They are overwhelmingly composed of voters who believe both the Democrats and the Republicans are beyond the pale.\n\nBut again, that is always how the argument goes. There is no better demonstration of the Democrat's sense of entitlement to progressive votes than the way they react to the greens. Acting as if they effectively just steal votes they should own by default. It's amazing to hear that coming from the party that presumes to be the one and only party interested in democracy.\n\nIn fact, it's the Democrats' job to convince people to vote for them, by representing and promoting policies they want to vote for, and by deserving their trust that they will indeed enact those policies if elected.\n\nAnd btw, it's kinda ridiculous to see AOC trashing the greens, saying things like \"if you can't grow your movement in so much time, you're just failing\" or somthing like that. In short, AOC belongs to a party that receives billions of dollars in campaign funding from the corporate class, and actively uses that funding to crush parties such as the Greens, either by litigating endlessly to straight up keep them off the ballots and to drain their modest resources, making sure their media allies give basically no oxygen to 3rd parties, keep them out of debates, etc. And then that same party seizes on the result of these attacks to say \"see, you're not growing, you're not a real party.\"\n\nThat alone is probably contemptuous enough to convince many voters to never vote blue.",

In reality, she is a threat to them long term. Most people who continue parroting the propaganda points like: \"it's a wasted vote, it's a vote for Trump, she is a Russian asset, she never does anything just comes around every 4 yrs\", etc., have never taken the time to actually go to Green Party website and learn how much she and the GP has achieved, how many elected officials they have all over the country, etc. Voting for Jill isn't going to make anyone lose an election. Electoral college decides that. If candidates don't care about gen0cide, American's well being, environment, corruption, it's their fault that people don't want to vote for them. No one owes them a vote if they go against American people and take bribes from Israeli lobby to pass laws that only benefit war industrial complex and foreign gvmnt. Voting for Jill isn't going to make her win presidency, but If Jill gets at least 5% of votes, she will get federal funding for next elections and a guarantee to be on the ballot in all 50 states. This election, GP spent majority of their campaign funds (without any federal funding) to fight lawsuits by Dems to keep her off the ballots. If she gets 5% vote, that won't happen again. Hence the huge disinformation and smear campaign against voting for GP right now. Also, if they get 5% vote, they will get more seats at a policy making table. So, don't listen to nonsense and vote Green. We have to dismantle the 2 party system and it starts this election!

I would never, ever, in a million years, vote for the Democrats or \"Center-left\" Neoliberals, so they never \"lost\" my vote because they never had it. I will never, ever give a \"thumbs up\" to Neoliberal polices.\n\nAlso voting third party does a lot to shift the debate. People pretend Third Parties \"do nothing\" but surging third parties cause massive ricochets through the political system. Look at Brexit, literally caused by a third party with a single rep, simply because they ate into Conservative polling come Election time. If the Green Party got 20% of the Democratic Party vote, you can be sure the Democrats absolutely would not be watering down Environmental policies like they usually do.\n\nSure the Greens might not win Presidency in living memory, but why in hell would you give you thumbs up to Neoliberals? There is no such thing as \"pushing them left\" when they are in power, the vote is the only voice you have. There is a reason Democrats don't move left, it's because the left never utilizes it's power, meanwhile \"Moderate\" swing voters do. (Also \"Moderate\" is a misnomer here, perhaps even a majority of these swing voters are economically left, socially conservative, the exact opposite position of the Dems and Republicans, so they bounce between based on usually what minimal policies resonate with them). Another issue is when you vote \"Yes\" to the Democrats, it is read by the media and politicians you are voting \"yes\" to their entire platform.\n\nThe Greens have issues. But they are not really known by people outside of the party. Typical factional ones, also the party due to being entirely volunteer based and \"New Age\" adjacent has many cranks, but lets be real, no worse than the Dems or Republicans who are filled with actively hostile cranks with terrible economic and social worldviews.",

And frankly, I agree. I agree that our two party system sucks. But realistically, Stein has no chance of winning the 2024 election. The green party isn't going to go from 0.3% last election season to winning this one... and Stein isn't going to go from 1.1% in 2016 to winning 2024.\n\nEarlier this year the French had National Assembly elections. The first round of elections were disastrous. The extreme right had so many votes, it seemed certain that they would gain control of the assembly. The shattered left was able to quickly put together a coalition in attempts to stave off the fascist extreme right. During the elections, the left and the center made a pact that if one of them had more votes for the first round of elections, the other would drop out in the second round and encourage their constituents to vote for the other. Many left and far left candidates voluntarily dropped out (some even dropped out despite having more votes in the first round, but the center candidate refused to go), and many people willingly voted for a center party run by Macron of whom they despise. They all knew that the existence of another party on the ballot is a high risk of allowing the extreme right to gain power. \n\nThe Green Party of the United States doesn't have this kind of mentality. They care more about their existence on the presidential ballot than the risk of a Trump presidency, a risk to everything the party fights for. Rather than focusing on putting Green politicians into substantial offices and helping the Democrats stave off a growing wave of fascism that the Republican party is more than willing to let in, the Green party would rather seek for relevancy by their existence on the presidential ballot.",

In reality, she is a threat to them long term. Most people who continue parroting the propaganda points like: \"it's a wasted vote, it's a vote for Trump, she is a Russian asset, she never does anything just comes around every 4 yrs\", etc., have never taken the time to actually go to Green Party website and learn how much she and the GP has achieved, how many elected officials they have all over the country, etc. Voting for Jill isn't going to make anyone lose an election. Electoral college decides that. If candidates don't care about gen0cide, American's well being, environment, corruption, it's their fault that people don't want to vote for them. No one owes them a vote if they go against American people and take bribes from Israeli lobby to pass laws that only benefit war industrial complex and foreign gvmnt. Voting for Jill isn't going to make her win presidency, but If Jill gets at least 5% of votes, she will get federal funding for next elections and a guarantee to be on the ballot in all 50 states. This election, GP spent majority of their campaign funds (without any federal funding) to fight lawsuits by Dems to keep her off the ballots. If she gets 5% vote, that won't happen again. Hence the huge disinformation and smear campaign against voting for GP right now. Also, if they get 5% vote, they will get more seats at a policy making table. So, don't listen to nonsense and vote Green. We have to dismantle the 2 party system and it starts this election!

The country is currently producing more oil every year [than any country in history](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\"\n\nAlso the Pentagon is the #1 contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and Biden approved an 864 billion dollar \"defense\" budget last year. The US supported genocide in Gaza, which has utilized more bombs by weight and power than WWII, has contributed to huge increases in climate emissions. According to the Guardian: \"First months of conflict produced more planet-warming gases than 20 climate-vulnerable nations do in a year, study shows\".\n\nI only bring this up to point out that so many people buy into the rhetoric of the Democratic party and ignore their actions. Or they pick and choose. Are the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Acts incredible feats? Of course. Has Biden also continued and hardened Trump's border policy while also hypocritically spouting pro-immigration rhetoric? Of course.\n\nThe boogeyman argument of \"Trump will be worse\" simply reveals how little Democrat-voting folks are paying attention to the darker deeds of their chosen party—a symptom of a two party system that forces you into boxes of moral inconsistency so as to appease a guilty conscience.",

Trump can say whatever he wants about canceling elections. It's pure theater. If he tries that, it will result in civil war and he knows that. Getting a third party, who doesn't take aipac and super pac money on the ballot, getting more seats at policy making positions is the best hope Americans have at getting back to liberal policies and government who serves US, not Israel, not war military complex. This scare tactic is created by two parties to keep them in power and control us. This is why Kennedy was forcing aipac to register as a foreign agent right before they eliminated him. He predicted this takeover of America and our elections, congress and policies. Have Dems passed any bills to benefit us in the past 4 yrs? Stop arming Israel? Fix any real issues? NO. We are screwed either way. Our policies are controlled by a foreign gvmnt.

The idea that the Democratic Party has any interest in promoting legitimate progressive legislation and values is comical. \n\nNot hearing Harris talk much about Medicare-For-All these days. Mum on the Death Penalty (RIP Marcellus Williams). But absolutely having a grand old time campaigning with Liz Cheney. I'm sure she is hard at work to stop the genocide in Gaza.\n\nRemember Bernie? The reason the Democrats were so painfully forced to pay lip service to the Left. Kamala was for Medicare-For-All then. The Dems were ruthless to Sanders, a bit like they are with Dr. Stein today. \n\nAnd it all came to a head on Super Tuesday 2020 when every Neolib candidate other than Joe Biden dropped out and immediately supported him, sealing away the nomination from the first real progressive with a significant chance in the Party's history.\n\nAnd then the Neoliberal Wing asked for the Democratic Socialists to sacrifice and coalesce around them to save the nation.",

It’s crazy bc some stuff is actually true that they say. \n\nBut I think for the most part people go on RT to promote their cause for like video clips when they can’t get any interviews with other outlets. The journalists/pundits that work there are ideologues and can’t get hired by U.S. media, but they got stuff to say. So I don’t think going on or working for rt is necessarily like insane. But yeah, it is a propaganda network that is trying to sway us elections. Rfkjr went on RT a bunch of times, too. \n\nRe: Putin photo. I’m not doubting that there’s something weird going on with that, but don’t you find it even weirder that the guy who kills journalists and tries to sway us elections would ever even allow such a photo to even happen? Like politicians have dinners with registered lobbyists all the time, but they like make sure that no one takes their photo. But Putin, in all his autocratic power, is going to let out that he’s meeting with the spoiler candidate to increase her chances at spoiling the US election. Super weird. Like the guy couldn’t have been like “no photos” and like had this security thing where he checked everyone for cameras. I’m sure the guy does that for weapons. I’m sure the guys got comprehensive espionage info on everyone that comes into his presence. So it’s weird that a photo like that even went on the internet. He must have wanted people to see the photo which raises new questions about the motivation for that. \n\nNo?",

She hardly gets any attention to begin with, but she does seem to comment on things in off years on Twitter and does seem to plug candidates in off years as well. \n\nI think there definitely is this effect where the Green Party candidate has the most traction in elections in which the democrat is more distinct from the Green Party candidate. They don’t pull hardly any votes in districts that already have progressive democrats running and it would make sense that they wouldn’t feel the need to run against them for the most part. \n\nThe question is why the Democratic Party is ever in a position in which left wing votes can be pulled away from the Democratic Party to begin with. I guess the Democratic Party is appealing to centrists in those areas. \n\nSo if you think about it, let’s say that the democrat did indeed decide to win the votes from the left wing so that the Green Party got fewer votes and didn’t spoil the election. The reason, from a purely non-ideological standpoint, would be that the center left votes would then be alienated from the party and vote for the republicans. \n\nSo it does seem like, whenever democrats want to accuse the Green Party of stealing votes from the left and handing the election to republicans, it does seem like there’s this implication that all of the sudden, the centrists will actually vote directly for republicans. \n\nSo there’s a tacit implication that there are centrist democrats that *aren’t loyal* that would swing the election if democrats  decided to appeal to Green Party voters. No? \n\nMaybe there’s just no way to get all of the votes. But I think if republicans are pretty far right (as trump is) it really shouldn’t be that difficult to just appeal to the GP voters and tell the centrists: “do you really want a trump presidency again?” Just as you’re doing now.",

The Democratic Party has made the decision to appeal to them rather than the Green Party voters. That’s a calculation they’ve made that it makes more sense to try to win moderate voters because there are more of them. \n\nBut the thing is that with someone like AOC or another left wing democrat, if they were to be running, you’d hopefully be saying the same exact thing to moderates who underestimate fascism. So it’s a calculation that has to be made in those swing states. I hope Kamala does try to appeal more to those voters if they are a liable to swing the election. That would be the smart thing to do. But it’s probably that their polling suggests that they won’t win those states if they try to appeal to the left. So it’s like, either way. I think Kamala is probably going to win. I said the same thing about Hillary. If she doesn’t win, she should decide to make those calls. \n\nIt just doesn’t feel real to me democrats can go as right wing as they want to and not lose voters on the left. It just doesn’t feel okay. You take like Joe manchin for instance. Am I supposed to vote for Joe manchin? Sure I am. Because the republican is worse. But where does it end?

They’re not brainstorming how to make Dems lose this cycle. They’re looking at what Dems share their values that they can endorse.

And if you are in an actually safe seat this math is actually different (though giving Kamala a mandate to govern if that still exists is something to consider), but definitely look at polls cause frequently fewer people are than people actually think. \n\nThe real problem is in having this discussion without every very specific qualifier on the table in front of the internet randos so they can’t convince themselves others agree with them and then pull this in Pennsylvania. It is actually very important that they run to the center but motivate the base, fortunately they haven’t run to the right on anything but border policy (and even then just in terms of rhetoric), literally all of their policy continues to be lefter and lefter but their talking points are aimed at the center and educated people need to not be babies and read the briefs. The only reason Joe Manchin matters is there aren’t more democratic senators to make his protest votes irrelevant.\n\nAnd the time and place to push them on policy positions or rhetoric we don’t like was in primary season against reps and senators, people do make claims about electability there too but it’s where the change actually begins to happen. The thing is Walz and Harris aren’t leftist icons, the entire discourse with AOC would have to be different by necessity because she is a different candidate and the only way to win would be furthering development of the young end of the base.\n\nIf they were actually moving to the right I’d have these concerns, they just have to rhetorically exist as both the center and the well meaning challenge to it (which is what they always have been) but it basically cannot ever be about punishing those in power. The left has enough mechanisms and the capacity for shame to remove most problematic elements of the party that do not compromise the whole, and we should thank our lucky stars it’s barely even a hard choice compared to places like India or South Africa. The other answer is political systems don’t have this assumption that the only lever we have is voting because in parliamentary mmp systems the leadership of the party is basically decided by the party - they can’t get rid of individuals who step out of line so the understanding that those in power need to be responsive to the needs of the public despite the public having voted for them is much more accepted.\n\nI also think they should be responsive to the needs of the public. I would love if they had a New Deal Era sized coalition to actually give any of it a shot though and then we can complain if they fumble it. In 2008-2010 they arguably did on some issues, but to be fair they were also busy, but that’s the last time they have actually been in power and then before that… basically modern conservatives at the head of dems in the 90’s after an age of conservative realignment in the 80’s.. and then like Carter? They have literally never had a chance in living memory to pursue and cement progressive change and the only time that ever has happened was under FDR, where after making everything better by basically just not doing the dumb stuff Republicans were he got a massive coalition and could then pursue many effective policies. The right had to change to even be in the room anymore. And the reason that happened was everyone got the heck on board. It can happen again, especially if Texas ever flips a seat once (cause then the massive numbers of people who don’t vote will know it maybe matters).",

This would once again involve a battle between Trump and the military. The last time, Gen Milley resisted such attempts. There are far too many centrists and liberals in the military for the military to accept such an action. I was one of them. Though the majority of those serving are conservatives or right leaning, the disparity tightens as you get up in rank, and then the trend reverses. \n\nIt is possible to engineer a takeover by putting the right leaders in the right spots. There will be warning signs. It won’t get past their peers unnoticed. Ham-fisted political blunders like Tommy Tuberville influencing general promotions and attempting to tie it to the “woke agenda” are the type of thing you can expect to see - because they are fucking morons that do not know politics half as well as they think they do - certainly not the strategic side, not like a career Soldier that has served in two wars and dealt with complex tribal politics in multiple distinct cultures. \n\nMaybe if they had kept the peace, and kept the generals fat and only book educated. Nope. They sent our Soldiers to the school of hard knocks for over 20 years. These dumbasses can’t have their coup. They need to wait another 20-30 years before trying something like that.",

There might be an amendment in the Constitution that says he can't but since when does the conservative Supreme Court majority care about the Constitution? They ignore it constantly. They just said that the President has complete immunity even though there's literally nothing in the Constitution that says so. \n\n3 of the justices were nominated by Trump himself, Clarence Thomas's wife was literally involved in the insurrection, and Alito was flying insurrection supporting flags at multiple houses. Trump will inevitably file a suit challenging any state trying to keep him off the ballot (guessing all the red states will keep him on it) and do you really trust that the Supreme Court will do the right thing? Not to mention that his Veep will be a sycophant and will be in control of the EC certification. \n\nAnd even if he doesn't run do you really think he'll leave willingly? If he wins he'll still be facing prison time when his term is up and we all saw what he tried to do last time. That was just a trial run.",

The United States has continuously existed in the same form as a political entity for 245 years. One man is not going to end it all. Plus, Germany in 1933 is not the United States now.)\n\nWhat a Trump presidency might do is use the president’s newfound immunity from core constitutional functions to attempt to rig the 2028 election in favor of the Republican candidate. Although because Trump only cares about himself and no one else, he might decide it’s not worth it to use the power of the presidency to help someone else.

I can only hope that you might keep asking questions, until you realize the extreme danger America is in.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set the table for this. \n\nIt’s like watching a slow moving train wreck, while millions of people cheer and clap.\n\nAt this point, it really doesn’t matter who the Democrats put forward, that person will be the only way to vote to avoid catastrophe.\n\nThose of you who are commenting that “the states would stop him”, or whatever other scenario you might imagine, you need to realize that it is YOU who must stop him.  Now!  Before it is too late.  Once he is elected, it is literally game over.  250 years of American history to be replaced with oligarchs and dictatorship.  \n\nFreedom?  Say goodbye to freedom.\n\nAmerica is literally in your hands.\n\nThe “lefties” don’t hate you.  They literally don’t hate anyone.  They want freedom for all, and fairness for all.

It will most certainly be the plan if he is elected again.\n\nAnd with what the Supreme Court has done, there will be no way to stop him.  Not the states, not Congress, nothing whatsoever.\n\nPower corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\nDo you think for one second, with nothing to stop him, that he would be willing to be held accountable in any way?  To be subject to a future election?  Not a chance.\n\nI see some hoping he will be too old (or dead) and therefore unable to take a third term.  You are missing the point.  He will appoint his successor.  It does not have to be DJT, in order for you to have lost your country.  Any of his offspring, or whatever Republican oligarch can seize the reigns, will carry the dictatorship forward.\n\nOnce the throat of democracy has been slit, there will be no resurrection, short of an actual civil war, which seems exceedingly unlikely in our lifetimes.\n\nLook at the Russians, forever unwilling to take the personal risk necessary to even begin to organize the overthrow of their government.  Who will be the ones to do so once Trump has turned America into a police state?\n\nYOU\n\n           MUST\n \n                       SAVE\n\n                                  HER\n\n                                            NOW.\n\n                                                      YES, YOU!",

First off, the Supreme Court is now stacked with far-right leaning with justices who have accepted millions in bribes and perks and have already committed atrocities we wouldn't have believed imaginable in the 2016 election cycle. There's no system to enforce any kind of ethics rule, so they're not going anywhere.\n\nAdditionally, they've now basically ruled that the president is above the law. Trump's lawyers had argued that theoretically, a president could send Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival - so as long as Trump can put for a meager argument to SCOTUS that he was doing this as part of his presidential duties, he won't be held accountable. Any high-profile dissidents would become Putin's Navalny and we'd be stuck with that.\n\nSo now that SCOTUS is on lock, it's about the people Trump would appoint, and especially for Secretary of Defense. It's highly likely he'll appoint either Michael Flynn or someone else who'd be more than willing to follow presidential orders to break with policy and turn the U.S. military on its own citizens. Flynn practically begged Trump to do it during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nSo, backed by the military, they could keep re-running the election until they got the result they want and violently quell any dissent from the voters who successfully chose the left-leaning president. This violence would be exacerbated by his paramilitary civilians. He's promised to pardon the January 6 crew, sending the chilling message that his paramilitary can also do whatever they want to their perceived enemies with impunity.\n\nI could go on and on, but the main takeaway is that no one is coming to save us if we don't keep him out of office in 2024.\n\nIf you've read this far, that's my take on your question. The rest below, I'm just getting off my chest.\n\nOn the brighter side, if voters can keep Trump out of office in 2024, the next elections should become easier and easier to win, as younger voters will be making up a large part of the voting bloc.\n\nIn general, younger voters don't want to gut the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Education, and other 3-letter institutions. They don't want a nationwide abortion ban that is already literally killing women in many states.\n\nThey don't want to return to a healthcare insurance system where insurers can turn away people with pre-existing health conditions - a provision of the ACA that the GOP will easily eliminate because there's no John McCain to save us and the SCOTUS would rule in favor the the insurance companies.\n\nThey don't want to imprison homeless people or put mass numbers of people in camps.\n\nThey don't want Palestinians wiped off the map so Jared Kushner can put up beachfront properties - These are Kushner's own words - except he said something like he'd \"remove\" the Palestinians in favor of putting up those properties, and it's on video.\n\nThey don't want Project 2025 to be enacted through the sheer power of having a conservative president. If you're unfamiliar, I beg you to look up a summary. It's not hyperbole. It's their own words, and basically it's game over - especially if you only consider that climate change mitigation would no longer be a thing.\n\nDon't believe me.

But threatening our countries economic, monetary, military, etc. stability could throw the world economy into an absolute free fall and I think that's where the buck would eventually stop, because it doesn't matter how your ratings are if the confidence in the US dollar and legitimately of the United States plummet.  Making money only matters if the money you make is worth something.  \n\nIf Trump successfully shuts down the federal indictments against him, I don't see why he would want to remain in office.  I believe that's his ultimate goal right now— to stay out of prison, and manipulate the system enough in these next 4 years where that will not be a concern of his anymore.  But he's truly a wild card, so maybe everything I've written is completely off base.  \n\nThere's been a lot of fuckery with the scotus decisions, but all are issues with room for interpretation of vague language that exists in our limited two page document. In regards to presidential terms, the Constitution is very clear that you only get two terms.  I don't see how it can be interpreted as anything else.  There's no ambiguity like issues of abortion, guns, etc. leave.  It's written in extremely precise language. \n\nThus, if he tries to stay in office the Constitution is officially null and void.  Rome goes from a Republic to a dictatorship, and we are in completely uncharted waters.  \n\nBut that will bring immense resistance because American political identity is not based on blood, but civic creed. The enlightenment ideals in our founding documents are the common bond.  Without those, what do we really have left that unifies is together?",

This will of course lead to massive damage because many departments that people depend on will become non functional (think basic stuff like the geology service, or NOAA, or anyone to do with any form of land management, agriculture).

Pp. 21–24....\n\n>...On Trump’s view, the alleged conduct qualifies as official because it was undertaken to ensure the integrity and proper administration of the federal election. As the Government sees it, however, Trump can point to no plausible source of authority enabling the President to take such actions. Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a fact-specific analysis of the indictment’s extensive and interrelated allegations. The Court accordingly remands to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.",

Harris is winning MI by a significant margin. \"MUH Palestine\" hasn't really hurt her despite all the hay that was made. The state party is also a disaster.\n\n\n2. WI is having its de-Republican gerrymander of the state legislature vote to drive out left wing voters. \n\n\n3. PA has had back-to-back Democrat wins when we were at peak inflation, Trump/the GOP's only real point to campaign on. (270 is locked with these 3)\n\n\n4. Harris is now leading in multiple polls in NC because Mark Robinson, gop governor candidate, is a certified psycho and dragging the whole state down. \n\n\n5. Biden won GA with the black vote and it's very likely it will carry Harris even further (This applies to NC too)\n\n\n6. Every single state has had demographic shifts that hurt the GOP (Less boomers, more Z, less white, less Christian, etc.). 2024 is harder for the GOP than 2020 which was harder than 2016 when Trump actually won.\n\n\n\n\nAs I said before, if you're looking at current polling, demographic changes and previous statewide election results in the swing states, it's Harris. If you're going by feels, you can still make a case for Trump. ",

Currently according to the same 538 its Harris 49.7 to Trump 45.4, and even before the Kennedy endorsement- if you assume the same poll bias as 2020 Trump is down by .8% in the popular vote, which is a smaller margin than he beat Hillary with- that race was projected to be 48.5 Clinton to 44.9 Trump and went 46.1 Trump to 48.2 Hillary, a bias of about 1.5%, and you'll notice the margin in that election was 2.1% of the popular vote.\n\nTo put it mathematically, the polls seem to favor Harris but those who followed the last two elections know that there tends to be a systemic poll bias in favor of Democrats that Trump has a good tendency to outperform.  \n\nAnd again, this is before Kennedy dropped out and endorsed Trump- not clear what the effect will be, most people seem to think itll be about a 1% bump in the polls for him.",

That also includes her VP Walz.    I believe mainstream media is very powerful over the thoughts of people.\n\nSame way the mainstream media totally trashed Sanders on a daily basis or ignored him even tho the people in their hearts wanted him, trusted him and loved his class based views, the mainstream media's power and influence in the end won out.  And by the mainstream media I also mean the ones that control the mainstream media made sure Bernie was out.  We all saw the DNC do that.\n\nKamala to the neolib elites may continue the neoliberal policies and wars that they love and make the MIC  and other billionaires and corporations lots of money and be easily controlled.  I think the powers that be also bringing in a POC without us being able to choose who would be VP, thought could quell the unease that is happening in the African American community with the Dems who are also now beginning to feel left out and at the back of the line, hurt also by the open border policy seeing undocumented get much more than they do and their needs met before theirs, legal citizens.

With it being too close to call in Georgia (leaning Trump), Nevada (Leaning Harris).\n\nFact is that the two most unpopular candidates in history were facing off (Biden & Trump), and now that Harris has basically positioned herself as a generic more centrist democrat who seems somewhat normal, that strategy good enough to take the lead.\n\nShe's been careful to minimize her attack area (you can tell Trump & their campaign is flailing, since they can't seem to stick to a line of attack which gets traction - like they had with Joe), and made a smart pick with Walz who manages to be satisfactory to the broader coalition (you know you've done well when you get a nod of approval from Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin), and he's a been sharp messenger.\n\nOf course, the next two months can change things. The big unknown right now is if Harris strategy of running out the clock on a generic approach will win out under scrutiny of hard hitting interviews (she did famously bad in her [interview with Lester Holt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omrMRP15q9M) talking about the border early in her VP tenure) and any Debates (she didn't do great in the 2020 primary debates when she was running for president).

Do people even know trumps economic polices this election? Trickle down with really high tariffs (aka taxes on foreign products).

She previously had a pretty low approval rating and was generally not very well-liked but since she's taken the spotlight she's only added to her popularity because people are seeing she's actually well spoken and competent. Trump and Vance on the other hand are only making things worse the more they talk. And that's not a left-wing talking point; Republicans are all trying to tell them to change up what they're doing. Trump has no actual platform, so all of his speaking appearances involve shit-talking instead of saying anything of substance, and people are tired of it. And JD Vance is such a dud that everything he says or does backfires.",

And I'm checking sources to investigate her or claims made about her and everything is checking out. I like her way more than I already did since usually VPs are out of the spotlight.\n\nI like that Kamala Harris is acknowledging the way corporations are hurting all of us. It would also help conservatives, and I want to move away from Donald Trump's divisiveness. I'd like to hear conservative issues that are tangible and cause direct harm to them, rather than metaphysical, confusing rhetoric from MAGA. That's real unity, not one man (RFK) looking for a job.\n\nThis is probably true for a lot of progressives and independents, but a lot of us actually miss our conservative loved ones, or who they used to be. I think conservatives vastly underestimate these last two points, and how much that can keep us hooked on Kamala Harris's message of unity.\n\nWe want to be able to go to Thanksgiving dinner again and not hear our loved ones fall down the rabbit hole of grievances that are *Donald Trump's grievances*. We're so done with the negativity, the gripes, the whining, and the toxicity. Donald Trump's upset he couldn't keep classified documents. Wah. I don't care about Donald Trump's problems, I care about my loved ones' problems. That's a pretty motivating factor for me.",

This would have been the case regarless of the president becuase it's a global problem. \n\nThere's also price gouging. Companies made record profits during the pandemic and onward. Only Kamala Harris acknowledged this and pledged to pass legislation to ban this practice. Why do no republicans acknowledge the fact that most large corporations are more profitable than ever, and yet the average worker is struggling?  The U.S. is the richest country in the world. Where to republicans think all that money is going? And why would a tax cut that mostly benefits the rich make any meaningful difference for people who don't make enough money to get taxed much in the first place?\n\nAsking if you were better off in one of the other terms is not a reasonable questions. We faced an unprecented global disaster that we are still recovering from. Inflation would have gone up under Trump the same way it did under Biden, but people probably would have gotten less resources to survive, and there would have been more deaths under Trump.",

(all an illusion btw)\n\nBut 8 years later everyone is well-aquainted with him and his bullshit, and saw that he didn't really do much during his presidency except create more division, and botch the pandemic response because of his lack of leadership skills and general incompetency.

So if Fox has Trump +1 and NBC has Harris +1, and the average is a dead heat, Trump only needs to repeat 2020 to actually be up +3.5  even just averaging all the polls. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say (and Nate Silver probably the best statistician when it comes to this stuff agrees) if the systemic poll bias remotely repeats itself again Trump is going to win this election easily.",

But if you spend ten seconds thinking about it....all it means is that more people are fleeing their countries, it has nothing to do with the state of the United States.\n\n**He's going to fix the economy!**  Though the specifics on that have mostly just involved him saying, \"DRILL MORE OIL\".

He's not only a narcissistic, mean spirited person, but he's also not even smart. He has nothing intelligent to say ever. It's the age old situation where the common folk are unhappy with their lives and are thirsty for change, so they'll just support whoever tells them what they want to hear. It's happened over and over again through history. It's exactly how Hitler came to power. Most of what Trump is doing is from that playbook. All his rhetoric about immigrants is literally the exact same thing Hitler did with the jews. He's trying to bring the people together with a common enemy, and if you vote for him, he will solve the problem! Really Trump is incapable of solving any problems and his entire career in real estate and other business ventures has been one failure and con after another.  And he uses this 'fake news' excuse as a way of discrediting his critics. So all his supporters just say \"it's all media propaganda\". That's another thing from the authoritarian playbook; turn the people against the media so they won't believe any of the bad things they hear (which are often actually true).",

Biden and the current Congress have provided Ukraine almost everything they've asked for.  Whereas Trump spent 8 years saying America shouldn't even defend NATO nations under some circumstances.\n\nThe real truth is Putin imagined he could make Ukraine a satellite nation through political maneuverings under Trump.  That is why Putin had people like Manafort (Ya know, the Trump campaign advisor) working in Ukraine to strengthen the pro Russian parties within Ukraine.\n\nSo your argument is....Biden is weak, but also Biden is also far stronger in his support of Ukraine than Trump.  It's nonsensical.\n\nLet me just quote your 'deterrent'.\n\n*“I said: ‘Don’t do it. You can’t do it, Vladimir. You do it, it’s going to be a bad day. You cannot do it,’” Trump recalled during his chat with Musk on X. “I told him things that, what I’d do, and he said, ‘No way,’ and I said, ‘Way!’”*\n\nNot that he's ever coherent, but notice how he can't articulate a reason as to why he's so 'intimidating' to world leaders.  Any other candidate could have given a list of policies that act as deterrents. But Trump?  Absolute empty nonsense.\n\nYes, this is the man Putin is terrified of.....\n\n\"Dems more authoritarian\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump\\_fake\\_electors\\_plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot)\n\nNo....the guy who spent two months after the election trying every half baked illegal scheme to undermine the election results is more 'authoritarian' than sleepy Joe could ever imagine being.\n\nAs his own Secretary of State said, he's a 'fucking moron'.\n\nAs his Chief of Staff said, 'he's the most flawed human being I've ever met in my life\".\n\nAs his Vice President said, \"he asked me to defy the Constitution\"\n\nThis is your hero?

I know this is a simplistic explanation, there are other factors involved, but that is the way it is unfortunately. I would vote for any reasonable adult. I would never vote for a lying racist, rapist, corrupt felon who started an insurrection. He is clueless about a great many things and is unfit to be president. You can obviously insult me, tell lies about Democrats, but every thing Trump has done is fact not fiction. He stole top secret documents from the government, he tried to steal an election. So many horrendous things. 181 scholars have named him the worst president we have ever had. There is a reason for this. The man is a terrible person. ",

Limit white collar and corporate crime prosecutions. \n\n-defang the SEC\n\n-turn the Dept of Homeland Security into one large deportation force. Round up migrants - even some here legally - inside deportation detention camps. Other people will suddenly start \"disappearing\" and family members will be left to wonder if and where they were shipped off to. If you eventually track your relative down in one of those encampments, good luck with the legal process to prove they've been wrongly detained. \n\n-Draconian pullbacks on mail-in voting and early voting in red and purple states (especially those with GOP legislatures and/or governors). \n\n-Nationalize state elections of federal officers. Counting votes ends at midnight on Election Day. Fed control of ballot boxes. Essentially martial law during elections. \n\n-Voter roll purges like we've never seen before. \n\n-Ukraine funding dries up and its military is eventually overrun. Mass arrests and executions as Russia gobbles it up. NATO frays. Another Baltic state gets overrun.  Putin begins the long campaign to reconstitute the Soviet Union. \n\n-US turns a blind eye to Israel going medieval on Gaza and the West Bank. \n\n-Thomas retires before the 2026 midterms and is replaced by Eileen Cannon or someone worse. \n\n-if the House at any point goes Republican, one of the three liberal female justices is found to have allegedly violated some law or canon of ethics and the right will attempt to impeach her (unsuccessfully). \n\n-if the House is Democratic, I'd bet on one and maybe two more presidential impeachments. No senate convictions of course, but the nation is tied up in Trump litigation again for months on end. \n\n-The retribution against Blue states will be mind-boggling. Wait till there's a major natural disaster in one and the Feds turn a blind eye. No FEMA, no disaster relief. The tax code will also be overhauled to punish blue states, much like the limitation of the SALT deductions during his first term. \n\n-Another drive to reverse or defund the ACA. Bring back the pushes to privatize Medicare and Social Security. \n\n-Religious fundamentalism is allowed to overtake American life. Be ready for prayers before baseball & football games and In classrooms. \n\n-Voting rights: even more curtailed. Same-sex marriage: gone. LGBTQ rights: curtailed. Trans and gender affirming rights: gone. Reproductive rights attacked on every front. Abortion criminalized - even if you travel across state lines. I can imagine my own state of Texas passing a law saying if you've ever participated in an abortion and you step into Texas, you can by charged with manslaughter (or worse). And you're left to wonder/worry if your devout Christian neighbors might secretly turn you in. \n\n-indemnify police officers and agencies at the state level. \n\n-numerous moves to repeal or otherwise defang the 22nd Amendment. \n\n-Emoluments Clause? What Emoluments Clause? Certainly that doesn't apply to the nation's Chief Executive and Commander in Chief! Right, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh?\n\n-FBI and DOJ investigations galore! Left-leaning media celebs like Bill Maher, Robert DeNiro, Lawrence O'Donnell and Joe Scarborough are Weinsteined in some form or fashion. Michael Cohen's parole revoked and he'll be prosecuted again. This is where the \"retribution\" will really kick in. \n\nI could go on, but you get the picture.",

That's the base we are working with.\n\nNow, let's avoid speculation and simply read the campaign promises.\n\nProject 2025 calls for immediately firing tens thousands of federal employed and replacing them with loyalists. It also recommends enacting the Insurrection Act to persecute Trump's enemies.\n\nSo the campaign promise is to remove all guard rails and institute martial law so that Trump can remove his Democratic opposition. That's not a lofty goal or hyperbolic speculation, that is the day one plan.\n\nHere is how Project 2025 describes the bureaucracy they plan to capture:\n\n>At the very pinnacle of the modern progressive program to make government competent stands the ideal of professionalized, career civil service. Since the turn of the 20th century, progressives have sought a system that could effectively select, train, reward, and guard from partisan influence the neutral scientific experts they believe are required to staff the national government and run the administrative state.\n\nThe goal is to make the bureaucracy unprofessional, incompetent, partisan, and biased.\n\nI do not think it needs to be explained how just this alone is problematic enough to count as a constitutional crisis. We can anticipate a chaotic, unchecked executive branch whose stated goals are primarily about seizing power and persecuting political opponents.\n\nThe difference between this and 2016 is the level of planning involved. The Republican apparatus did not expect Trump to win, and had a disorganized responses subject to the vicissitudes of Trump and the splintered nature of the party at the time.  They did not have what was necessary to enact an agenda before Democrats seized Congress in 2018.\n\nThis time, they have a top-down plan and a party purged of dissent. They understand to a much greater extent that they need to act quickly to seize and keep power, and won't wait for the Democrats to have a blue wave in 2026. And they have a sense of urgency; the personal consequences for swinging and missing include jail and worse.",

This would (among other effects)\n\n•\t⁠remove their whistleblower protections,\n•\t⁠make them firable at will, and\n•\t⁠remove their positions from the merit system, making those positions fillable by the President at will.\n\nThus, re-issuing that Executive Order would allow the President to \n1. Fire anyone who disagrees with him simply for doing so and without regard for merit, and then \n2. Fill the newly vacant position with a loyalist — regardless of competence. \n\nThe newly-installed loyalist would lack whistleblower or other employee protections, meaning they would almost certainly never push back against illegal orders, abuses of authority, dangers to public health or safety, or gross wastes of federal funds (all things whistleblower protections cover). \n\nThis installation of loyalists and lack of pushback would enable the President and his agency heads to do virtually anything they wanted, regardless of legality or basis in evidence — unlike in the last Trump administration.\n\n\nTrump has said this is what he’s going to do. Russ Vought, James Sherk, and so many other former Trump admin officials have said this is exactly what they’re going to do — in Project 2025, in news interviews, on podcasts, in congressional testimony, and in every other forum in which they’re given the chance. \n\nr/Defeat_Project_2025\n\nProject 2025: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise",

There will be city-clingers (more at first) but there's more than enough room in this country for all of us to spread out and stay the hell away from each other, at least in smaller groups we can live among.\n\nAs for an actual conflict, honestly I think Civil War got it essentially correct. Any attempt at doing anything will seem scary as hell and be kicked off like a war drum but it will be short-lived because these people simply are not smart, and there aren't enough of them to really put these actions into place on a grand, organized scale. The military will not execute Americans en masse, and knowing that will be enough to throw everything into nonsense. In all reality, the government would quickly turn into a shit show as soon as the grownups abandon ship. The states who actually have their shit together or can quickly get it together and join forces will likely restore some semblance of order, but I think the country will never fully recover to how it is now.",

It is a detailed plan to dismantle much of the US federal government. The document intends to replace, competent, experienced professional bureaucrats with radical authoritarian political hacks. To most people unaware of what it advocates the document probably sounds innocuous. But having read some of it, Project 2025 is literally terrifying to me.\n\nProject 2025 proposes criminalizing pornography, removing protections against discrimination based on sexual or gender identity, and terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and affirmative action. It calls for national book bans in schools, and also creates a list of banned words for the federal government that would be deleted from quote, “every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, and piece of legislation that exists.”\n\nThe document also denies climate science and plans to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, the most ambitious climate law in US history and expand drilling in the Arctic wilderness. The EPA is slated to be eliminated almost completely. The EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights would be closed, and its staff, including the science advisor, to be selected based in managerial skills rather than scientific qualifications. Funding for climate research would be cut while the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would be reformed along conservative principles. Science research in general would be subject to being \"conservative\" or defunded or completely blocked if not sufficiently \"conservative.\"\n\nProject 2025 recommends abolishing the Department of Education, whose programs would be either transferred to other government agencies, or terminated.",

Just to start with, ignore court rulings he disagrees with and order his administration to act accordingly.  Perhaps even attempt to suspend or end the Constitution entirely.  To attempt to make a \"new America\".  And for starters, it would be wholesale ignoring of the 22nd amendment... if not attempting to declare that the 2028 elections are simply \"cancelled\" (assuming he lives that long).  No matter what or how, he will try and stay dictator for life.\n\nOh and:\n\n> Emoluments Clause? What Emoluments Clause? Certainly that doesn't apply to the nation's Chief Executive and Commander in Chief! Right, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh?\n\nThat already happened in the first term.  He was in clear violation of the Emoluments Clause and the DOJ and Congress did nothing.  So, already the precedent is set.",

He won’t dare increase taxes for poor people, but he might defund a lot of federal programs; Obamacare, medicare, social security, education etc. \n\nI don’t think Trump has the focus and determination to see through project 2025. It’s not his project and I’m guessing he doesn’t see how it will directly benefit him.\n\nThe bigger picture will be much like his first term, just chaos.

The day after it will be something else.\n\nOh… and then there will be golf.",

He won't be able to fuck with the budget much, and they can impeach him if he does illegal shit.\n\nEven though the Senate would be guaranteed to acquit, I think a D house could impeach him multiple times and basically gum up the works pending the 2026 midterms, in which Trump would be destroyed same as 2018.\n\nI have a glimmer of hope for holding the Senate too.

I'm cautiously optimistic Ds can take back the House on that alone.\n\nIf Trump wins, it's not going to be like 2016.  It's going to be him maxing out the MAGA vote like crazy and the D vote being stagnant, young people voting RFK, not voting, or some other nonsense.\n\nThat actually creates fairly favorable conditions for Ds to win the House back.

Would Germans? Would the French? \n\nI personally would have to answer \"yes\" because the alternative is the collapse of NATO, which is a long step towards widespread remilitarization of Europe and eventually a larger European/worldwide conflict. However, I think a majority of Americans would be saying to themselves [\"Latvia? Where's that? Why should I care?\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_(policy\\)) And Trump's administration would be very much encouraging that attitude.\n\nFor Putin, once Ukraine is done, he'll need something to continue Russia on a war footing - politically, economically, even religiously. And taking the Baltics would be a great way to shatter NATO's Article 5 promises of mutual defense, which would be a huge win for his legacy.",

He has shown time and time again that he is more than willing to break those norms.\n\nAnd all that he needs are institutions adequately bent to his will. And in 2028 he very may well have that with an even more rightwing judiciary, a gutted executive branch thanks to Project 2025, and a more extremist Congress.\n\nTo act as if the norms are impenetrable ignores both the actions Trump is taking to degrade them and how close his previous attempts actually were.\n\nHe wants to be authoritarian. He's actively taking steps and drawing up plans to ensure that. No democracy is foolproof. What makes you think ours is?",

        "selftext": "I’m no demographics expert, but I feel like just by common sense, this election should be a lot less close than is projected. For starters, around 15 million Gen Z are now old enough to vote, having been too young in 2020. Gen Z leans rather significantly left. And in the last four years, millions and millions of older Americans have passed away, and their generations lean right. Further, one would have to assume that Covid disproportionately affected older republican voters. \n\nWith all of these factors tilting the scales, why is this election not an almost guaranteed win? I doubt that very many people who voted for Biden will switch to trump, so it feels like it should be rather comfortable for Harris (though I’m sure it will end up being a tight race like it was in 2020).",

This generation coming up is more active politically than any generation before them!\" is a common narrative every cycle, but the fact of the matter is that doesn't really happen. Obama was probably the only modern exception that I can think of. Old people vote at really high numbers (relatively). So the online Gen Z political discourse can skew 99% Democrat, but if they are all in a solidly blue or red state or don't end up actually voting, it doesn't matter. The election comes down to only 7 or so states. If Gen Z were to vote in numbers like the Gen X to Boomer aged people, it'd be a landslide, but when pollsters crunch their numbers they adjust for how likely someone is to vote and Gen Z just isn't statistically likely to vote at a high percentage in states where it matters.",

That naturally tends to a two-party system, and over time the parties tend to adapt to balance each other.\n\nHistorically, when a party shrinks, it tends to \"expand its tent\" to appeal to more voters.

There is no really good way to approximate the things we learn from elections without actual electoral results. Polls, debates, issue tracking, fundraisers, rallies, protests, etc all of these things are just parts of ways to learn some of the stuff that elections tell us. We still default to elections as the definitive voice of the people in part because they are hard to simulate or replace with anything else.\n\nSo how do we actually predict elections? Well, in the modern era, we largely approach it from two different angles: punditry, and science. Pundits are not very predictive. They make all sorts of predictions that often do not come true. They hope that they make enough predictions that folks only remember the ones that happened to come true and forget all the ones that didn't. That's obviously a poor way to predict an election. The other option is to use science by focusing on what has been the best at predicting past elections. We're a bit better at this.\n\nBut when I say a bit better, I mean it. Going back to the beginning point, nothing is really completely predictive of elections, especially this far out. Polls are often the *most* predictive, but in July? They've got *tons* of error. Yet we largely rely on polls more heavily than anything else because of all the things that have any predictive value, polls have the most, even in July. Which, again, isn't all the reliable.\n\nAnd right now? The polls say it's a total toss up. That's really the long and short of the answer. We think the election will be close because the polls are close. Are there other factors? Absolutely, again, *polls are not predictive and this far out from an election are often full of error*. But there is absolutely no possible way to look into the future and predict it with any degree of confidence using all those other factors. We just do not know which ones are going to be relevant.\n\nPersonally, I don't think this election will be close. I think the polls are either suffering from error or will shift dramatically. I think there's a lot of reasons why the Reps will strongly underperform and the Dems will overperform. But do I have actual facts and evidence to back that up? Nope, no one does. We only have narrative analysis to suggest why we might be right, and it could be that we look back and see certain analyses vindicated. But we cannot predict the future, so we default to the what we know: polls, which the most predictive thing we have, are close, and therefore, the election should be close.",

Afornedample Biden has, objectively, been an extremely successful president and the economy is booming by many standard metrics (the very metrics trump bragged about over and over). Consumer spending has reflected this since COVID. \n\nNevertheless Americans are svery glum about the economy and report \"struggling\" even though wages have outpaced inflation since COVID.\n\nThe main reason for this economic malaise is that there's been an absolutely insane OR campaign by Republicans about how this economy is actually the \"worst ever\" because they can point to inflation and gas prices and pretend like it's Biden's fault- completely ignoring that this is a global phenomenon driven by macro-economoc factors and that much of this inflation is consumer driven because of the post COVID soending boom. Really basic economics and obvious stuff, but the PR campaign has been so intense that almost ALL Republicans now repeat what they have been told to think in unison, and republican pessimism is SO out of wack with economic reality that it's affecting how independenta and even liberals view our current economy.\n\nCouple this with the fact that Republicans have successfully branded themselves as the edgy, counter-cultural alternative to the do-gooder politically correct Democrats and suddenly you find much of the population being completely blinded to what an obvious choice this election should be and acting like this is a tough choice.",

In the USA, the 30-year drive toward isolationism (interrupted by 9/11 and Afghanistan) is now moving ahead at full speed, pushed by both extremes, MAGA and Progressives. This is happening as Russia and China are rushing to fill the vacuum of our withdrawal. Biden slowed it and woke many centrists to the dangers of anti-global instincts, but Trump, Vance, Kamala and Walz are all anti-globalist populists with ZERO foreign policy experience. That is a problem for centrist Republicans and Democrats.\n\n(2) Forget the Polls. There is no statistical model for what is happening in the world over the next 5- to 10-years. The polls are based on historical data, but both the Republican Party (probably with this election) and Democratic Party (by next election, or the one after) are collapsing into camps. The Democrats are held together only by their opposition to anything and anyone perceived as contaminated by the Right or Republicans and Republicans lost Religion, Law & Order, The Constitution, Foreign Policy, etc. in 9 short years. Labor, RINOs, Globalist Democrats, Police Unions, Wall Street Businesses, and Main Street Businesses are all homeless right now. Tech businesses and Media (including Liberal Media) know that their days are numbered with Democrats and that the days of 24/7 cable news is over.\n\n(3) You mentioned Demographics and have probably heard of Peter Zeihan if you want a broad overview of demographics, but frankly the winner is going to be the side that can get their heads out of their ideologies and break through the information silos to talk directly to the homeless factions of both parties. There is no poll for that.",

Many Republican voters exist in an ecosystem where the news they receive is heavily skewed. Many Republicans don't even know what happened on January 6th. I, like you, think it's a clear choice, VP Harris is the only true leader on the ballot. But others don't even know the very basic facts.\n\nAlso, former President Trump is good about tapping into people's hatred and fear. He's made it so many of his voters consider supporting him part of their identity. It's really hard admit you supported the wrong candidate when you make that support a big part of your identity (as opposed to those of us who just try to make the best choice and use trustworthy media to see whether we should change our mind in the next election).\n\nETA: I also heard that many of the Gen Z this time around are too young to remember some of the awful stuff former President Trump did-- the wall, banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, calling white supremacists \"very fine people,\" etc. As lots of these folks get their news from social media, not CNN/NBC, it's harder for them to know about what actually happened in 2017-2021. (Before people get mad, I'm Gen Z too. No shade intended, just pointing out trends.)",

If people were truly making their decisions independently, a dead-even split like 50/50 would be statistically near-impossible. What’s even more unsettling is how these numbers stay stagnant, not moved by any major changes or event (and we had a lot). It’s not natural.\n\nWhat’s clear to me now is that we’re trapped in a feedback loop. A significant chunk of the population isn’t thinking for themselves; they’re reacting to the polls. I call it the \"buffer effect\"—borrowing from chemistry, where adding acid to a buffer solution doesn’t immediately change the pH because of a salt reservoir. This reservoir absorbs and neutralizes the acid, keeping the pH steady—until it can’t anymore. Right now, that buffer effect is in play with voters.\n\nUndecided voters? Listen to the interviews with them after the debate, many of them are, in reality, Trump supporters or former ones. They’re hesitant, perhaps even embarrassed to admit it, but they’ll only claim to vote for him if they see him starting to lose. They don't want to align with him openly but don't see Kamala Harris or the current administration as a good choice, as they crave for some change. This hidden vote is massive for the effect to be this big and the polls to be so stable.\n\nWhat scares me most is that the reservoir might be more willimgbto vote than we realize, with people choosing chaos just for the sake of change, unable to admit their true leanings out loud. It’s not a vote for Trump—it’s an indictment of Biden and Kamala. But in the end, the result is the same.\n\nI really hope I’m wrong about this. But if I’m not, don’t flaunt your vote. It could only feed this feedback effect, and if this buffer is just invisible in the polls it may be too late already.",

Pollsters actually have to make a bunch of assumptions when determining the results of a poll (as is common with most statistical modeling). These assumptions have changed between elections in order to try and make polls more accurate. \n\nLooking at the current polling situation, so many polls are showing tiny margins that it actually defies statistical theory. In the event of a completely tied race, due to sample variability, there should still be more variation in polling results than we are actually seeing. I think that about 60% of swing state polls show a margin of 1% or less, which is extremely unlikely. \n\nI’m not skilled enough in statistics to give you a detailed explanation of why, but it might involve pollsters making assumptions that favor results showing a close contest because they believe (a priori) that it is a tied race. Also polls that show a greater margin favoring one of the candidates may not be published due to the pollsters worrying about their reputation or discarding the results as erroneous. \n\nTake home message: polls are not an exact science and they are subject to errors and biases. Maybe it really is a tie, but more likely we will see the actual results diverge from most polls by quite bit. This will of course give the losing side plenty of ammunition if they decide to cry foul.",

Which blows my mind considering how unbelievably bad he was as a person/president. Its going to be so close he will most likely contest the outcome if he loses the electoral college and then his supreme court will anoint him King.  \n\nIf everyone shows up and votes though and we sweep the house, the senate and the presidency maybe it will be such a landslide there would be no chance of him disputing it. But again, republicans have stacked the deck and played the long game. They are the minority but the board is theirs. It's like playing monopoly but the one player you can't stand is the banker, has all the hotels, and has already won the game for all intents and purposes but he wants us to keep playing just to take every last thing from us and all we can hope to do is land on jail or in a final moment of exasperation kick the board game over and find a better game to play.",

And also a lot of young people just feel pretty hopeless after a few years due to the cost of living and negetive press so they figure why bother its the lesser of two evils, its not even representative it goes through electors. Either way we are stuck with a declining country. All of congress are retirement age people and that generation has done nothing but gatekeep us from opportunity. All they care about is their damn pensions and property values. For example they'll talk about wanting to support the lower/middle class, but shoot down every building permit for affordable housing in their area because my property value would go down. SO why would i trust those boomers to make decisions that benefit me and improve my life. How will they understand the challenges I face nowadays, and how the heck are they going to understand what we need to safeguard against threats in the future. Have you heard these guys grill tech CEO's. They know NOTHING about technology, and their supposed to understand how to leverage AI to country the Chinese rise? It's a joke, and why even put your energy into it at some point. I think most young people either dont know enough yet or simply have given up on their vote changing anything for the better.  \n  \nThe gop have lost the popular vote since before I was born but they still win sometimes. Also as people are saying GA, NC, NM, PA,WI, and MI are the only ones that arent a forgone conclusion. It also mean although harris may be slightly favored, she does need to win basically the whole blue wall or win GA unexpectedly to win. There are a lot of lean trump states this year probably just because people are fed up with Biden. Cant say anythings really cheaper or feels better despite whatever economic or crime numbers they claim. The perception is actually what matters more. Becuase without that your sense of security is gone and your trust in institutions go down.

It is not really a function of any particular thing that's going on right now, since this phenomenon has been consistent over almost all of modern American politics.\n\nIt feels like young people are super active and involved. That's largely because most people we see in media are relatively young. Your athletes, musicians, activists, comedians, actors, etc. \"Popular culture\" is almost inherently composed of young people. Most of what you see from the culture coincides with the priorities of younger voters, so it feels like there is a consensus and a wave of energy in that direction. But the vast majority of people at that Taylor Swift or Chappell Roan concert or that flock to the internet to support an athlete or comedian that comes out in support of some cause will not vote. Meanwhile, there's thousands of older Americans that see that and are motivated to vote against it.

We have the sickest generation of children we’ve ever seen. Half of whom are prescribed at least one pharma drug by the time they start school. The food industry boxes up the same exact food for Europe containing clean ingredients, while that same product is given to American filled with chemicals and carcinogens. The news talks about soaring numbers of childhood cancer, rare cancers, heart disease,  diabetes etc continuously on the rise but don’t know why??? The FDA doesn’t have to answer to us I suppose and politicians don’t hold them accountable. Idk why more people are not up in arms over this and demanding change for these serious issues. We need more powerful people advocating for us, protecting our health. There are so many ways besides pharma drugs and shots to heal our bodies but the left seems only to be an advocate for pharma, so much so that they will destroy a doctors career if they are using anything that pharma doesn’t approve of, even if it’s actually saving 100% of their patients! The democrats will help their pharma pals and together they’ll revoke licenses, destroy their characters and the news puppets will tell you what a quack that doctor is. it’s unbelievable, a disgrace. Whew sorry I tend to get fired up once I get going lol I know it’s prob impossible at this point but I really do wish all the people  left right and center could be an army of one❤️🙏 We need to bring back healthy debate and try to understand each other, without fear of our loved ones threatening to cut us out of their life",

Of course, that causes young men to become reactionary, so naturally the party catering to men by suppressing women will draw them in. However, when all these young men are actively going against what women want, they’re pushing them away. \n\nThey don’t call it a “male loneliness epidemic” for nothing— and we can’t understate the appeal conservatives have when they’re all about forcing women to serve their husbands and children. In that case, young men can continue to be as bitter toward women as they want with zero consequences… just like previous generations.",

The Donald lost the popular vote to Hillary in 2016 by 2.7 million and to Biden by over u million. So basically the electoral college says in 2016 2.7 million votes did not mean anything.

But.\n\nThe polls are in a dead heat, [FiveThirtyEight puts the national polls at 40.9 Trump to 40.0 Biden](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/). 20% are either undecided or saying they'll vote for RFK (which, spoiler alert, they won't). That means we're in for an unpredictable nail-biter \n\nI've had terrible dismay the past few months watching as Trump flubs again and again and it has no impact on the polls. But I think that's because he's already hit his floor of support. I think that, in the ballot booth, the undecided voters will be more serious about evaluating Trump v Biden and vote against Trump.\n\nFiveThirtyEight's projections are that \"the fundamentals\" favor Biden, but the fundamentals are weird this year. Voters hate inflation, and they blame Biden. Also, apparently there are polls that a majority of Americans think we're in a recession?? and blame Biden. You can see that economic sentiment is very negative on reddit, too.\n\nMaybe Biden will see a surge of support with the national conventions and once the campaign starts in earnest. Or maybe he actually is old and just won't make for an effective campaigner this year. I don't know. It's nerve-wracking and I think it will continue to be anxiety-inducing until all the votes are counted.",

If you look at polls right now for example, trump looks at least as likely if not a little more to win as Joe Biden. Going off of favorability gives you the same result while asking people who they are more enthusiastic to vote for puts trump up.\n\nHowever, All of those metrics failed to predict the poor showing for Republicans in the mid-term elections in 2022. If we used only those, Republicans should have won around ten-fifteen or more house seats than they did, and they should have won the Senate by a seat or two if not more, instead they lost a seat. \n\nPersonally, I'm going off what was a good bell weather for that midterm election. The special elections of 2021-2022.\n\nSpecial elections are ones held outside standard election years/times for various reasons. Usually due to a public official leaving office early or being impeached.\n\nYou usually have around six-twelve of them per congress session (every two years), so they aren't a massive pool of data, but, they give you something polls can't. Actual voting data from an election. \n\nRight now, every single special election held during this congressional session to my knowledge ended up going for Democrats far more than expected. Similar to the ones prior to the mid-terms.\n\nA recent one in Ohio, held in a district that voted for trump by around +30 points, and its previous gop representative by +35 points, shifted over +20 points towards Democrats. The Republican still won by 9 points, but that kind of shift in under two years since the last election there in 2022 is bonkers. To put that in perspective, if California had shifted that much in 2020 towards trump, he would have won the state, and while the other special elections have not be that crazy, they all have shifted for Democrats so far (as far as I'm aware).\n\nCurrently, trump is up nationally by around a point according to polls. In the swing states it's between under a point and five points. If the special elections indicate a polling error  anything like they did in 2022, then with the polls as they are it's likely Trump loses the election. \n\nThat all said, anybody saying they 100% know how the election will turn out is lying. We are all reading tea leaves and chicken guts trying to make educated guesses. I'm just going with what I personally see as a decent bell weather.",

The worst part is, so many believe that there will be someone to catch this stuff and fix it, to keep it under control, that used to be true maybe, either that or someone stood up and took control to guide the nation. But if you have truly been reading, listening, and watching, the GOP has telegraphed their intent quite clearly. Just look at the abortion issues, contraception, and the way they regard LGBTQ. There have been articles and reports on local and state legislatures who are defiant towards the federal government, that have passed legislation that disenfranchises voters. It won’t be because of voting numbers people, it will be because those in power rather than upholding the laws and rules agreed upon by their fathers and grandparents, they have decided that they need to subvert the process in order to win.

Biden can outperform polls like Obama vs Romney and still only have around the popular vote margin of Hillary's election.\n\nIf you remove the polls, my opinion: I think people are pretty dug in on Trump vs not Trump, the difference should come down to turnout. Democrats are in danger of deflated turnout because young people are invested in Palestine and don't like Joe's performance.",

He was already unpopular in 2020, but the electorate's desire to see Trump gone far outstripped conservatives' enthusiasm for Donnie. Well now, he's confirmed much of what the left feared about him. It's one thing to vote for a guy you're wary of. It's another to vote for him after he spends 4 years confirming your misgivings. \n\nIt COULD work in Joe's favor that people are as desperate to stop Donnie as they were in 2020, but I doubt it.",

Biden's only hope with them is the knowledge that Trump would take the pressure off of Israel entirely, end support for Ukraine, do nothing about student loans or climate change, and would be at the mercy of the business cycle as well.",

The first is that Democrats have wildly \"overperformed\" in almost every special election that has taken place ever since the midterms, which itself was a massive upset that no one saw coming. As recently as a few days ago a special election in ruby-red Ohio (a district Trump won in 2020 by almost 30) swung 20 points away from the GOP candidate compared to prior elections.\n\nSo this really does beg the question - are the polls grossly misrepresenting \"likely\" voters, or otherwise missing some vital clue in the data? Or are people just saying they support Trump/GOP because the people who go against those folks tend to get death threats and publicly humiliated?\n\nBut more importantly, why are Democrats performing so well even in traditionally deep red places? It's hard to ignore, and even harder to imagine this clear trend won't affect Trump in the general election.\n\nAnother key indicator in my mind is the sheer number of GOP primary voters who are still pulling the lever for Haley and Christie despite the fact that both dropped out of the GOP primary months+ ago. Imagine how motivated you have to be to show up and vote in a primary, for someone who is no longer in the race? These people clearly do not like Trump and are clearly motivated to show it. How likely are those people to \"come home\" and vote for him anyway in the general? Some percentage will, but the problem for Trump is he needs to greatly increase his pool of voters from last time. Any defections are going to hurt his chances.\n\nI think the polls will stay close until like 1-2 months before the election, when people are forced to actually face the choices in front of them, and on election day I am fully confident that Joe Biden is going to win re-election.",

Less certain, but I think Biden will hold on to most or all of the critical swing states he won in 2020. Republicans endorsed by Trump performed worse than expected during the 2022 midterms, plus abortion has proven remarkably effective at getting women and young people to the polls, so that hurts Trump considerably.\n\n- Trump tried to overturn the election results, set off an insurrection attempt and is now a convicted felon this time around, all massively negative labels he didn't have in November 2020.\n\n- Economic growth and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic has been markedly better in the US than in other countries. History shows that it doesn't matter whether people think we're in a recession or not (a lot of people think we are), rather it only matters whether the Fed says we are or not - and the Fed has not declared we are in a recession. This helps Biden.\n\n- 2020 should serve as a lesson that we are not going to see landslide presidential elections in the US again any time soon. Under normal circumstances, the failure to handle a social and economic upheaval on the scale of Covid-19 would have doomed the incumbent to lose in a landslide. Yet, Biden beat Trump by a margin of just 4.5%. In addition to this, Trump's fundraising skyrocketed after his 34 felony charges. MAGA isn't going anywhere. \n\n- People think RFK Jr helps Trump, but I think he helps Biden more for the simple fact that RFK Jr's conservative, individualist views on personal issues like vaccines draw in people from the crowd that used to support Trump, but now have moral issues with Trump after the fallout of 2020. Why would a Democrat ditch Biden for RFK Jr? RFK Jr is a threat to Trump, not Biden.\n\n- Despite MAGA zeal, the 2022 midterms demonstrated that a lot of voters - especially younger voters - do not agree with GOP ideals. Also, after 9 years of Trump running for president, I think many people who voted against him in 2016 and 2020 will be just as motivated to turn up to vote again to once again tell him to beat it. \n\n  \n- 0 of Fortune CEOs support Trump. Not a single one. Not to say they're all endorsing Biden, but none of them feel Trump is good for the business world. It can't be a good sign for Trump that even people from his own craft have serious doubts about his competence.\n\nMy final verdict: Biden is re-elected, but by a smaller margin than in 2020. It'll be breathtakingly close - I'm going to put it down as anywhere between 0.2% and 0.9%, principally as an explosive mixture of MAGA enthusiasm, Trump repudiation, disillusionment with the economy, and reduced turnout compared to 2020. The dreamer inside of me wants so bad to say Biden will do better in the general election than in 2020, but I feel our contemporary political and cultural landscape has showed that just will not happen.\n\nOther possible outcomes: Trump narrowly wins the popular and electoral vote due to the \"nostalgia vote\" as people believe he can bring back things to how they were in 2019.\n\nWorst case scenario: The Supreme Court does a repeat of 2000 and overturns a fair Biden victory, instating Trump as President and sowing the seeds to cultivate Project 2025. It's likelier than I'd like to admit......",

First, he has no need to pick on anyone (as much as he enjoys it), this detracts from his own personality making him look mean and like he will talk shit about you after you leave (I don't know how true that is but no need to exude that quality).\n\n\nStick with Harris Biden failures since it's such a plentiful bag, let her ruin her own chances without rubbing it in her face, her VP isn't helping either, so just ignore them completely and act as if he could care less what Kamala says since she hasn't proven anything that she says she's about. Poking fun at her gives others a way to say they don't like Trump because he's just childish and mean even if he's half joking. Most people understand Trump's sense of humor, always saying he's perfect and handsome is simply his way of warming up to people and he's not actually thinking it constantly, it's just his goofy way of mentioning himself. There's lots of people that do this and lots more that stretch the truth as Trump likes to do. You just have to know what to look for and what to ignore.\n\n\n\nLast and most important, he needs to start putting Vance in the spotlight with him way more often as a reminder that you're really voting for 2 people! They need to be able to compliment each other in the right way. Good cop bad cop or fearless with reserved contemplation . Showing that Vance will be part of this administration far beyond what we've known any other VPs have been (look at Pence, what the fuck was he along for that ride, he was effective as Harris was for Biden).\n\n\nTrump's known for doing things his way and if anyone represents change in our government, Trump's proven that beyond a doubt. If he can make this a tag team presidency where Trump can depend on Vances intelligence and even tone to represent what Trump knows how to do but might not be the best at explaining it nicely, I believe there would not be a chance for Harris to get ⅓rd of the votes. They're just not working with what they have. You'd think with a team of people orchestrating his campaign, someone would have been able to put a better way for Trump to associate with those who don't like \"him\" and are stuck on that.\n\n\nVance can be the one that removes that problem simply by appearing with Trump on a regular basis from here on in. They don't need to cover much ground of say much, just show the public that they represent real leadership and self control by showing Vance as Trump's well thought through pick as VP and how they can work as a team to come to conclusions that have been viewed from all angles.\n\n\nHe continues on as he has, he's never going to gain a significant lead even with Harris unable to articulate an answer for anything, Trump leaves too much (for thise who don't get him) to criticize and keep them from voting for him.",

I would not underestimate Trump and say “the polls are wrong”.  In fact, democrats have underperformed polls during the last two presidential elections",

Republicans have won the popular vote *once* in the past 34 years. Trump is one of the most unpopular candidates ever, has only gotten more unpopular, is racking up felonies, and didn't win the popular vote in his other two elections. And somehow he will buck a three decade trend and win the popular vote? C'mon.\n\nIn 2016, with two incredibly unpopular candidates, less than 6% of voters went for third parties. And somehow Kennedy is at 9%? What??? \n\nThe election is going to be close. Probably closer than 2020. But right now the polling just seems unbelievable, to be honest. I think whatever method they use is very flawed. Maybe it will become more believable as we approach November and more people tune in but right now it seems like utter nonsense.",

So these “fundamentals” are doing a lot of work.  With that said, we are also 5 months out with 11% undecided and 9% Kennedy.  Polls have been very stable but they WILL eventually change.  I agree that Trump has hit his floor.\n\nThree big unknowns are the economy, Trump and abortion.  Can Biden change the narrative to make it less of “the economy is great and voters don’t know what they are talking about” to “trumps covid handling set us up for failure and we are recovering better than any other country but we have a ways to go”?  Can this election be about trump vs Biden instead of just a referendum on Biden.  People HATE Trump but people also have to remember what trumps first presidency was like.  And will voters keep abortion in mind?  It’s rarely a top issue for most voters but when it’s brought up, people LOATHE it.  Democrats need to keep remembering that republicans took away their rights and want to take away more",

However, that has to be weighed against the potential damage of getting the worse option.\n\nThe potential payoff of your vote is the difference between the quality of option A and the quality of option B. So when the quality difference is small, the payoff from voting is too and that can, at some point, make that payoff smaller than what you could benefit from another strategy like abstaining  in order to signal to a party that they lost the vote of people like you and should do something to appeal to you next time to increase the votes they get. The greater the difference in the quality of candidates the more that voting the lesser evil is an inevitably superior strategy. \n\nIt also makes sense to look at the context you are voting in though. The last time my state voted for a republican president the Soviet union still existed, the internet didn't exist and blockbuster was a brand new company. In that context, the importance of my vote as an independent is enormously different than somebody in a swing state.

We have a child or children that’s in foster homes that get raped then   we have the  father rapes his daughter to pass on his lineage, and the Republicans will force her to have her father baby so many reasons but soon none of that’s going to matter because we are living in the end times make America great bullshit.

We have lost our way as a country. Truth matters. Lies are infectious and powerful. More people than anyone thought will believe them.",

You're obviously free to decide to vote for who you'd like for any reason, but this local trial with local jurors and a local judge only relate to New York.

I don't know *anybody* who answers coldcalls or texts anymore. I'm pretty sure a Venn diagram of the overlap between people answering these polls and people who are sending thousands of dollars in iTunes gift cards to the \"IRS\" is literally just a circle. That is to say the people answering these coldcalls are very much a specific demographic. Polling agencies say they can account for the demographic skews but with headliner numbers like, \"Trump is winning the popular vote\" it is just not credible, IMO.",

You are simply not capable of recognizing why they're doing these things: They don't think it's the best thing for the country in the long term. \n\n  \nJust to expand on those examples:\n\nMost Republicans I know don't give a shit if you're LGBTQ - They just don't want that lifestyle to be seen as a trendy personal branding by impressionable minors, who then want to make permanent modifications to their bodies so they can \"Fit in\" with their increasingly LGBTQ-identifying peers, some of whom are undoubtedly confused and just identifying as LGBTQ when they're most likely not. \n\nMost Republicans I know think that legal immigration is great, and they welcome people who make the effort to become naturalized citizens - They just don't want illegal immigrants coming in droves, causing delays to legal immigration and potential drains on taxpayer dollars whether due to social welfare programs or criminal incarceration. They also think it's dangerous on a national security scale, since we don't know who is actually in the country, and for what possibly nefarious purposes. \n\nMost Republicans I know have woken up to the reefer madness bullshit, and don't particularly care for marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol, and think it should all be legal and taxed - They just don't want to see the real hard shit like crack, heroin, meth, etc decriminalized and available on every street corner like we're seeing in Oregon, Washington, and California. \n\nMost Republicans I know understand that we will not solve the inherent problem with anger and violence in this country by restricting guns - There are ways to address the root causes and lower the risk of violent outbursts, while also securing currently weak targets that are constantly being attacked, like schools, and still be able to keep guns as relatively unrestricted as they are now. \n\nMost Republicans I know recognize that a traditional, monogamous relationship between a providing man and modest woman, ideally with multiple children, has been the bedrock of our society for hundreds of years - Young women getting on OnlyFans to flaunt their bodies are not being modest, and while they are being providers, they are doing so in such a way that is damaging to themselves, their future professional and personal prospects, and to the children they might one day raise. The pornography use also encourages polygamous relationships that historically do not work long term, and doesn't create a good home life for children, if any are had.\n\n\n\nYes, Democrats have different perspectives on these topics, and different opinions and solutions. That doesn't mean they are inherently correct just because you identify as a Democrat yourself. Republicans are often derided as being in a cult, but I have seen far more criticism of Republicans by fellow Republicans, than I have Democrats by fellow Democrats. That is not the cult-like behavior I would expect of Republicans, if I were to believe people on social media. \n\nAnd just for clarification, I'm not saying Republicans are inherently correct on any of this either, but I do think Republicans seem to be far more based in logic and pragmatism than a lot of Democrats, who deal with feelings and idealism.",

Leaders that suggest or these politicians associate themselves with that claim that LGBTQ is perverse and mental health issue? How about the Christian nationalist that want to replace the constitution with biblical principles and make the Christian faith paramount. Project 2025? A presidential candidate who openly speaks of revenge and retribution mixed with wanting to be a dictator. Sorry the GOP is almost shoving me to follow the Democrats. I have not seen anything really from the Democrats that come close to any of this. I do swim outside my bubble and read what Fox News and the like put out and it’s mostly just identity politics. I don’t see the scary monsters that conservatives and GOP see. I see personal responsibility and taking change as it comes. How many claim women should be relegated to the kitchen? What about them? \n\nThen there is your mention of corporate adoption of LGBTQ. It’s not legitimate anyway. Most LGBTQ know that most industries and companies merely exploit their “support” for profits. But instead of fighting these corporations directly, leaving their opinions and beliefs about LGBTQ out of it, they let it loose and make it seem like some conspiracy or something. Not the corporate bullshit that it is. \n\nI would get into the fun crap, but I don’t have the time and I can clearly see your mind is made up. Fine whatever. \n\nNot to you personally, but \n\nNo one is coming for your guns\nNo one if forcing you to become LGBTQ\nMost people that are LGBTQ happen to be normal\nReligion needs to stay out of government this includes:\n- Right to choose for a woman and women are allowed to have as many partners as they want. \n- Pornography has been freely available on the internet for (checks watch) decades now, where was the outrage when it showed up in the first year? Or were the Republicans at that time merely in name only or just couldn’t be bothered? And many in the GOP seem to regard anything LGBTQ as pornography and anything they don’t agree with as fodder for restriction. \n\nAnd on and on and on. Sorry I don’t see the GOP as a savior. I see them as adversaries. They are making every effort to be seen that way. I have yet to see any meaningful legislation or ideas that happen to align with helping anyone but their own constituents, especially the fervent ones who hold the most fundamentalist. Sorry there is grey. There is such a thing as circumstances that cause reason to be applied and bend to offer an option that offers a solution for all parties. But they and their rhetoric seem to be used to inflame, maybe it’s all bullshit, and yet their policies and words speak volumes about their kindness, compassion, and frankly competence in general. \n\nThey have never found any evidence for voter fraud in again forever. None. When checked it was in fact the opposite. Yet they still hold firmly to the idea. I’m only decrying it because there has been article after article showing evidence of tampering and of rule changes on a local or even state level that stem from the conservative run areas showing how they disenfranchise, plan to disenfranchise voters. If it’s not that it’s a vote for allowing abortion and again the GOP run state governments representatives saying plainly that frankly they don’t care what was voted, that they will do as they please. Doesn’t sound democratic, sounds illegal in fact, but hey I’m a layman. Then how about where federal rules are in place, they don’t agree with the rules or laws and they choose not to abide. Sorry again I’m not seeing representatives I can trust to follow how I vote, none I can trust to fulfill their promises. Or if they are out there it’s very very few outliers who happen to be in a position where if they speak out they generally don’t give a shit, and but then there have been others whom after seemingly gaining a backbone completely flip. So sorry, you’re going to have a massively difficult time convincing anyone like me that I’m seeing a boogeyman where there is none. You’re going to have an extremely difficult time convincing me that they are trying to do the right thing. They don’t take ownership of their faults, they make no apologies, they don’t try to correct themselves, they only double down. Somehow thinking by doing so that it will just work itself out.",

I can post the actual numbers if you don't believe me.\n\n2)The corporate rate was slashed but Corporate Net income Revenue from 2017 to 2024 has doubled. \n\n3) Your source is speculating based on a static intererpretation of the law as you are. You assume that lawer rates mean lower revenue. The truth is that lower rates reduce the incentive to shelter income so more income is taxes and when you reduce corproate tax there is more incentive to produce so economic activiy increases and more people have more income to tax. Revenue increases.\n\n4) Biden DID NOT start with record inflation no atter how many times he says it. Inflation the day he was inaugurated was 1.4% and the average annual rate for Trump's Presidency was 1.9%. OTOH Biden's average annual inflation has been 5.5%\n\n5) What led to inflation was deficit spending. Covid Stimulus CARES Act was $2.2 Trillion which probably would not have caused inflation if that was all we spent. But Biden doubled down and spent an additional $4.4 Trillion. When you print and inject $6 Trillion into the economy it causes inflation. Inflation didn't peak until Nov 2022. This is all on Biden.",

They are saying their model has a bunch of fundamental weighting where they are expecting voters to eventually come home to Biden and for that incumbency advantage to kick in.  I’m personally doubtful for that by seeing just how stable the polls have been but I’m a pessimist.    The optimist in me says that the “double haters” hate Trump more so that eventually Biden will catch up.  But it really remains to be seen how impactful Biden’s incumbency actually is, especially since Trump is also a previous president too.  If the polls don’t change then the chances for Biden in that forecast will drop.\n\nSo, realistically, anyone who is confident that one side will win or the other is bullshiting.  The polls do have Trump ahead but there is some good reason to believe that gap will close.  Will it be enough?  Who knows.  It definitely will be closer than 2020",

IIRC, Democrats were the ones pressuring the shutdowns, while Republicans were trying to keep the economy moving. Democrats can't exactly cry about inheriting a situation that Democrats caused. \n\n\n\n> Enforcing laws isn't weaponization.  \nNo, but suddenly changing the rules (Not laws, mind you, because that would require congress - This was all ATF) on pistol braces, frames and receivers, and the definition of being in the firearms business to try and hem up tens of millions of gun owners is, absolutely.\n\n  \n> Being held accountable for criminal actions  \nExcept, no criminal actions had taken place. DHS put out a bulletin on \"Militia Violent Extremists\" that featured iconography from the nation's history and pop culture that is typically displayed by conservatives (Particularly conservative gun owners) and classified all of them as MVE so that they could put gun owners on watch lists. \n\n  \n> That was Newsome.\n\n[Warren, Schumer, Broad Democratic Coalition of Lawmakers Urge President Biden to take Executive Action to Address Gun Violence Epidemic, Limit Sale of Assault Weapons | U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (senate.gov)](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-schumer-broad-democratic-coalition-of-lawmakers-urge-president-biden-to-take-executive-action-to-address-gun-violence-epidemic-limit-sale-of-assault-weapons)\n\nApologies, it was basically all the other Senate Democrats writing to Biden, who then turned around and lobbied the financial district.\n\n\n\n> The increase in IRS agents was specifically to target audits for high income earners.  \nAnd where are all those high-income audits?

Every single gun control speech, if it's not the fucking deer in a kevlar vest, it's this line. \n\n  \n> Republicans turned down a bi-partisan bill  \nWhat else did you leave out that the bill would it have included?\n\nIt would only kick in if the border reached X number of people crossing it per day, which was a Democrat addition, and either doubled or tripled the actual number coming across, so it could never be used. Oh, and it also had more war funding, which was stuffed in there by the Democrats. \n\nThe Republicans just wanted a solid border bill that would provide immediate actionable support, not including the asterisks and earmarks. Of course they weren't happy with the bill, and blocked it.\n\nAgain, the Democrats can't exactly cry about a situation the Democrats created. \n\n\n\n> has support among majority of Americans\n\nYou know what else has support among a majority of Americans? \n\nFixing shit in our own country.",

I'll try to address some of it, but there's no way I'm trying to unpack all of this. \n\nLGBTQ - It's all an extension of what Republicans see as adults pushing ideologies on impressionable minors - Especially their own kids, that they definitely don't want subjected to those ideologies, but also other's kids that they think shouldn't be subjected to it either - with trendy, peer pressure imagery, slogans, and influencers. For better or worse, those extreme reactions are them wanting to protect minors from those ideologies until they're old enough to fully understand them and figure out for themselves what's going on in their own bodies. \n\nChristian nationalism - This is another boogeyman term I see thrown around with no real connection to reality. Yes, politicians may be religious. Yes, politicians may use their opinions, which are undoubtedly informed by their religion, to vote for or against legislation. But I haven't seen a single politician directly say that they want actual, biblical, Old Testament law integrated throughout our country. Even the most fervent Pro-Trump people would stop and say \"Hold on a minute...\" if someone said that at a campaign rally. This seems to be an overly broad and hasty generalization about some political motives leading to an unrealistic conclusion. \n\nProject 2025 - As far as I've seen, that was the work of an ultra-conservative PAC consisting for former Trump admins, but not at the behest of Trump, or any other Republicans. What I've read of it is very unlikely to work in reality, and as far as I've heard, hasn't been adopted or acknowledged by any Republicans. It's effectively a fan-fiction. \n\nGuns - \"No one wants to take your guns\" ...except for all the politicians, PACs, judges, bureaucratic agencies, social media influencers, and the masses of people all either actively scheming to, or overtly saying that they want to ban and \\~\\~confiscate\\~\\~ mandatory buy back guns, harass and imprison gun owners, destroy the companies that make guns and ammo, bomb the NRA offices and conventions, register gun owners on public maps like sexual predators, put a 5000% tax on guns and ammo, forced watching of unedited video of children being slaughtered before buying a gun, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.... I'm a gun rights advocate, a gun educator, firearms trainer, former military, and competition shooter, and this is a topic I spend the vast majority of my time following, watching videos about, debating on social media, etc. I'll freely admit that I'm somewhat ignorant on other topics, and I'm just commenting what I've personally seen Republicans talking about, since you asked me specifically. But the issue about guns is something I'm deeply familiar with, and I've seen these all of these talking points, and a lot that were much crazier, all said about guns, gun owners, and gun companies. You can plainly state the true anti-gun goals, at this point. We already know what those goals are.\n\nPornography - You should go back about 150 years, and look at the various obscenity laws, some of which have been argued over regarding content on the internet, like pornography. Traditionalists have always cared about the corruption of people. That's not any different now. \n\nVoter Fraud - I think the issue here is that they can't truly validate whether or not there is voter fraud, because our voting has always been based on the honor system. We don't have national voting ID laws or digital voting rolls that can be marked off in real time to prevent voting more than once, so the Republican argument is that we can't tell if Bobby Jones went and voted three times. To them, the fact that massive fraud hasn't been proven is only proof that we don't have the proper systems in place to be able to prove whether or not fraud has taken place.\n\n\n\n> I see them as adversaries.\n\n  \nIn one of my other comments in this thread, I lament about this. No matter whether you're Democrat, Republican, Green, Libertarian, Independent, etc, we should not view each other as enemies. That causes division, and our country is already far too divided. We won't fix anything if we allow ourselves to hate each other.",

These tax cuts will cost almost as much as the COVID response bills yet don't produce any tangible benefits for the economy. \n\nBiden didn't control the YEARS of near zero interest rates that led to unfettered borrowing, he didn't control the piss poor federal response to COVID that necessitated rounds of funding to clean up, he didn't control OPEC trying to combat his energy independence records. \n\nBiden didn't start with record inflation - he inherited the office and the circumstances that led to it.",

I see the representatives that not only spew, but through rhetoric encourage said division or out and out their despise nature toward other fellow citizens. The innate need to create a them and us mentality. Who seem for all intents and purposes have an agenda that takes no consideration or concern for those the laws and regulations they want to pass will damage others. I know that many conservatives would prefer to roll back the clock and all that, however these people are in power. They have a certain level of responsibility for decorum and sanity, but they can’t seem to shake it. So you’re fine, so is any other right wing person so long as they are not actively looking for bloodshed and turmoil or are happily willing to look the other way.\n\nAs for the religious aspect, there are several candidates and representatives that advocate. Such as MTG and Lauren Boebert. Both declare how they are Christian Nationalists. Each preach biblical law. Again if they are just voicing their personal views that would be one thing, but they seem to be running on it. They seem to be betting on their religious views as their ideals. There are others still. \n\nSo there is a rise of LGBTQ. One could make the argument that biblical teaching is perverse and disgusting. The idea of patriarchy and how it diminishes a woman’s role in society. But honestly if people want to practice this way of life, have at it. Don’t go cramming it down my throat with law. I can’t help it if the LGBTQ happen to have better methods of getting through to the population than say traditional life or religious beliefs. Sorry, but what does that have anything to do with the freedoms of this group, their right to exist JUST as much as conservatives way of life. We have freedom in this country supposedly, and yet hanging up a flag, or wearing merch that shows what someone is is suddenly some kind of imposition. I’m sorry. You won’t see me calling for the extermination or silencing of conservatives if my son chose to go down that path. I won’t love it, but it’s his choice. But so many conservatives especially in leadership positions seem to see it as a mental disorder that needs to be eradicated. I can’t help it if two women or men raise a child and they end up gay in some fashion, just as sure as those same parents can’t help it if the kid grows up hating their parents and become ultra religious conservative. If these parents need to protect their kids from ideologies then maybe talking to their kids about it would be best, perhaps allowing their kids a free mind and presenting an alternative argument would be helpful. The difference between a child and an adult is time and experience. And the decision to regard a human in either camp is arbitrary at best. I know 30 year olds who should still be considered children from the way they present and act, not to mention the decisions they make. Yet we feel the need to control everything about our children. And once they cross that threshold it’s all up to them. I digress. \n\nIf I go back 150 years…1874?! I fail to see what point you’re trying to make here. That there was a massive misunderstanding of health and science back then. Most lived in squalor and dirt? But because it was hard on promiscuity and lewdness it was somehow better? Seems kind of silly. Seems just odd choice. There are still millions on this ball of dirt that have massive misconceptions about how sex works, hell how our bodies work. None so bad than how a woman’s body works. But we can’t teach sex education because that’s dirty? Or it encourages the already horny adolescents in our schools to have more sex? Sorry I don’t know one person that wasn’t already experiencing and experimenting by the time that the sex ed rolled around. But again I digress. Fact is you’re not addressing my original question. I would hear the odd news story about this lone senator or some such, complaining about porn or some such. But not to the extent it is now. Seems to me it really picked up once LGBTQ stepped in. Once they showed up the conservatives took up arms. Seems like it’s a disingenuous battle cry. You might claim I’m ranting, yet they seem to be the ones ranting. But hey free speech. Go for it. I don’t appreciate, or approve, but who the fuck cares what I think. Again here comes the leadership, not calling for calm evaluation or metered response, just out and out removal of everything. The statue of David was deemed as pornography. It’s classic ancient art… huh?! It’s been in textbooks for decades. \n\nSorry these politicians these representatives, these leaders, who seem to relish that they are hurting people by the way, they smirk when confronted or told how their policies hurt people, and instead of at least putting on a face to express concern (real or not) instead they signal that frankly they don’t care. They are supposed to represent all the constituents in their purview not just the ones that voted for them or might vote for them. That level of contempt, mixed with the policies they engender just makes them all the more not worth my time.",

That means total revenue  to the government is $200,000.  The budget is balanced so we spend $200,000.\n\nNow we generate a tax cut of 2% so the new tax rate is 18% and revenue goes down to $180,000. That assumes static accounting, everyone just pays the new rate. So, now we have a $20,000 deficit.\n\nYou instinctively assume that a tax cut means less revenue. However, that is not what happened. After the Trump Tax Cuts Revenue went UP ever year from 2018 to 2024. Therefore, the was no need to \"cover the cuts\". Allowing people to keep more of their own money doesn't COST the government anything. We didn't \"issue several trillion in tax cuts\" we just let people keep their own money. \n\nSo, in my simple  example, if revenue goes UP. and spending stays the same we should have a surplus, NO?  The only reason we would still have a deficit in the face of rising income is if spending INCREASED more that revenue.  THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED. Revenue increased but spending increased more.",

According to most liberals I see, especially here on Reddit, they equate their fellow citizens, who are conservative voters for those politicians, as \"Happily willing to look the other way\" when that politician does something that the liberals view as harmful to X, Y, or Z group. Since apparently everything does some measure of harm to some group, that means, by default, most liberals seem to be viewing most conservatives as political adversaries. \n\n\n\n> Both declare how they are Christian Nationalists. Each preach biblical law\n\n  \nIf this is true, and they actually believe themselves to be Christian Nationalists, I haven't seen it. I think it would be monumentally stupid of them to actually want that outcome in a country where they, being two women, can only hold the offices they do specifically because the USA isn't a Christian Nationalist nation with biblical laws. That's a different topic, though. \n\n\n\n>  I can’t help it if the LGBTQ happen to have better methods of getting through to the population than say traditional life or religious beliefs. \n\n  \nLGBTQ has better methods because they have dozens of PAC organizations lobbying the government to create or adopt things like Pride Month and National Coming Out Day, while traditional lifestyles, which are heavily based in religious practice and morals, are expressly forbidden from doing because of the separation of church and state. \n\nUnless the child is already being raised in a traditional, religious home, there's literally only one option for awareness between those two paradigms, and it's now being taught to children in schools as young as kindergarten, usually without parental knowledge or consent. \n\nThat's part of the reason conservatives feel so strongly about that issue. It's not just during and after puberty, it's being taught to literal children. TikTok teachers have videos all over about how their rooms have all the various LGBTQ flags on the walls, and how they go over pronouns the first day of school, but they won't hang a USA flag or teach them about George Washington. \n\n\n\n> If I go back 150 years…1874?! I fail to see what point you’re trying to make here. \n\n  \nMy point was that you're wrong about conservatives only taking issue with pornography on the internet in the last couple of years. In the 1860's, they were arguing about a book with drawings in it. They've argued about it for even longer than that. When the internet became widespread, the argued about it then, and they've argued about it since. \n\n  \n>  Fact is you’re not addressing my original question. \n\n  \nI'd love to try, but I can't find any semblance of an actionable question in these ranting replies of yours, so I'm just trying to hit broad subjects that you're meandering around. \n\n\n\n> They are supposed to represent all the constituents in their purview not just the ones that voted for them or might vote for them.\n\n  \nI'd love to be able to agree with you on politicians \\*should\\* be doing this, but the reality is,  liberal politicians don't pretend to represent their conservative constituents either. What we expect of one group must also be expected of the other.",

Are you volunteering to collect donations for those suffering? Are you pressuring Hamas to agree to the ceasefire? Did you participate in the primaries to move the policy toward what you claim to want? Did you campaign for the person you felt would best address this one major issue you are passionate about? Or did you just engage passively by \"liking\", reposting, and commenting on Social Media?\n\nTruthfully and sincerely, the conflict in this region is immensely complex and has roots going back thousands of years - it is not simple to solve. While one can point to Isreal killing innocents, one can also point to Hamas using those same innocents as Human Shields. While one can say Isreal is taking the conflict too far, one can also point to Hamas' actions on Oct 07 and subsequent holding innocent Isrealis hostage. My point is there is no simple answer to the problem in Gaza.\n\nThat begs the next question - which party is most likely to enable a return to peace in the region? The Democratic party who sponsored and secured a UN resolution for a cease fire (https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15723.doc.htm), or the party who's former UN ambassador wrote \"Finish Them\" on a missile intended to be shot at Hamas (https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-nikki-haley-finish-them-1.721850) or the former president who wants Isreal to more aggressively pursue the conflict (https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/trump-on-gaza-war-israel-comments-not-what-they-seem.html)? \n\nWhich party is more likely to result in more lives saved? Which party will be more likely to influence the global community to address the issue - the one who strengthens engagement with allies (the current administration) or the one who has persistently alienated the global community? Which party would be more likely to persuade a sovereign country (who frankly was attacked and is endeavoring to reclaim their hostaged citizens as would any country in similar circumstances) to be more restrained in their military campaign?\n\nWhile you may think Biden has not done enough, your choices as you've laid out are:\n - not vote (will at best have no impact, but most likely will tip scale toward the \"worse of two evils\")\n - vote 3rd party (which would at best have the same effect as not voting)\n - vote for Trump/Republicans (which as I've indicated above would escalate the conflict in addition to all the harm to civil rights of your fellow Americans and citizens, likely result in a shift to authoritarian government in the US which would diminish your vote further should you ever decide to vote in the future, and would (from what I surmise from your comments) move government further away from your ideals)\n - vote for Biden/Democrats (which as I've shown above have already secured a cease fire, are working to further diminish suffering in Gaza, are more likely to build a global coalition to achieve an outcome that continues to reduce suffering,  and would be a move closer to your stated objectives and ideals)\n\nIt is up to you to vote your conscience. But ask yourself, who would a Gazan vote for given the choices above. Would they sit the vote out and hope for the best? Or would they vote for who would move the needle closer to the goal they want. Now realize they don't have this privilege - but you do.\n\nI get it, voting isn't easy. Parties and their leaders are not ideal. Sometimes it feels you are voting for the lesser of two evils. But that is what it takes to make progress in a democracy. Change is made one vote at a time. A marathon is finished ine step at a time, not through one giant leap. So help the country move one step closer to what it is you want rather than sit on the sidelines and expect others to do it for you while you complain \"they are not doing enough\".",

        "selftext": "With the upcoming 2024 election, there’s a growing concern about what might happen if Trump loses again. We all remember January 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. This event didn’t just happen out of the blue—Trump’s rhetoric played a significant role in inciting it.\n\nIn the days leading up to January 6, Trump repeatedly claimed the election was stolen, despite no evidence supporting these claims. During his speech on January 6, Trump told his supporters: “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore”.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican National Convention (RNC), several speeches highlighted the intense rhetoric surrounding the election. Donald Trump, after accepting the GOP nomination, made a passionate speech where he described himself as a fighter against a corrupt establishment. He warned of “chaos and destruction” if he wasn’t re-elected, framing the 2024 election as a battle for the soul of America.\n\nRepublican leaders also echoed this combative tone. J.D. Vance, the vice presidential nominee, emphasized his alignment with Trump, warning of the need to “fight” against perceived threats to American values. These speeches collectively built a narrative of urgency and confrontation, which could fuel concerns about potential unrest if Trump loses in 2024.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the rhetoric from Trump and his supporters has intensified, with some openly threatening violence if he loses. On Truth Social, users have expressed their willingness to take drastic actions, with comments like, “If they steal the election again, we won’t just march on the Capitol, we’ll take our country back by any means necessary.” \n\nGiven these statements and the current political climate, do you think we’re at risk of another January 6-style event or even a civil war if Trump loses in 2024? What steps can be taken to prevent this from happening again?\n",

I think many who are fearing another Civil War are seriously underestimating how many things are going on in the life of the average American. Most people care much more about their personal finances and their family’s future, than they do about politics and who is president. Even most Trump supporters will move on with their lives if Trump loses. A vocal minority like those who rioted on January 6th, 2021 is nowhere near enough to start a Civil War.",

Republican support just didn't exist for all intents and purposes until AFTER the civil war ended.

In the time of the Civil War, the states that relied most heavily on slavery & had intense economic interest in keeping it were all concentrated together in the south— I’m not aware of polls during that time but it would not have been contentious in most of those places to unite against the north.\n\nToday’s political divide does not have these same contours. Not only are states of one party not contiguous, but no state cracked 70% party support in the 2020 election. So, even in deep red Wyoming, at least 30% of the population does not side with Republicans, and vice versa with Vermont. Add onto this that population centers overwhelmingly skew Democrat, and it’s hard to see how either side effectively creates a team. More Democratic cities would blockade Republican forces from manufacturing and arms, and Republican forces would cut off Democratic strongholds from travel or perhaps food. There would be innumerable fronts of war all at once across the country, much too chaotic for a Red vs. Blue matchup. \n\nIf something that extreme were to happen, an American edition of the Troubles feels more realistic. \n\nI don’t even see that happening, though, to be honest. Politicians love firey rhetoric, but cower when confronted with the terror it eggs on firsthand. There would immediately be lots of money and power being wielded to stop violence of any kind. \n\nMass unrest would also deeply hurt the status of the United States. Our currency value and ability to hold extensive debt, for example, is heavily reliant on stability. The major parties agree on almost nothing, but both are invested in their power. Being head of one of the split US successors would be a significant downgrade from the whole thing, especially if countries got nervous and called on us to pay our debts, if our currency tanked as a result of the uncertainty, etc.",

Either they would have to leave home for an extended period of time to go to cities to protest or they will be fighting against themselves.  The older ones may have the spirit to fight but not the physical prowess to do it.  There is a big difference getting into the capital when they just open gates and doors and follow you around vs having the national guard there to protect the property or to quell uprisings.

The risk vs reward will be getting questioned at every level and I think it will be clear the blocks for Trumps own convictions will be falling so going to bat for him is going to be a hard sell. You will most likely just end up facing charges in a year or two.\n\nThe MAGA movement and far right conservatism has been pretty deflated since Jan 6th. Seeing people do the thing of getting up and physically trying to revolt only to anti-climatically fail and end up in prison while the dear leader went back to his resort home to shill NFTs was really demoralizing for them I think. \n\nAnd the conspiratorial side of conservatism is super paranoid any call to action is just a fed trap. \n\nI think most conservatives will just be deflated. Some tiktok freakouts of them praying for God to change reality or screaming from their truck angry that everyone else didn't do an insurrection. Most will seethe but that's their normal state. There might be a few extreme cases of violence but even if they are successful it will just be a tragedy that turns people against conservatism. \n\nThe GOP will more likely collapse into infighting and confusion as they try to figure out where or if they can get off the MAGA train and how they can rebrand away from MAGA/Trumpism. The finger pointing and accusations of betrayal will be flying everywhere. Trump will want to fight for his presidency for the rest of his life but the GOP establishment will probably be eager to bury this period and pretend Trumpism never happened.\n\nIts going to be chaos but largely chaos for rightwing politics.",

Senator Ted Cruz publicly supported a frivolous lawsuit that used ludicrious statistical reasoning to state if it weren't for fraud Joe Biden had less than a 1 in 2 *quadrillion* odds of winning PA. He played his part in the disinformation campaign whose purpose was granting a permission structure for local election officials, state legislatures, and anyone else in a position to do so to not certify results that would lead to Joe Biden's victory. He is still a Senator. \n\nSenator Ron Johnson was involved in the attempt to hand off fake electors to Mike Pence and it only didn't happen because the Pence office refused to accept them. He is still a Senator. Bonus points: During the Republican convention J.D. Vance without dissembling stated it was perfectly valid for Republicans to accept the fake slate of electors for PA because they didn't like PA's voting laws apropos mail in voting. He is still a Senator. \n\nDonald Trump just had SCOTUS go to bat for him and not only rewrote the Constution to allow DJT to remain on CO's ballot but also stated that he has immunity for any communications between him and staffing of executive offices **even for the express purpose of overturning an election.** Roberts directly says, without adjucating the truth value of it, that even if Trump was ordering the head of his Department of Justice to send out a memo to states lying about finding evidence of election determitive levels of fraud as part of a pressure campaign to get Republican officials at various levels of government to work counter to Joe Biden taking office after rightfully winning the election you can't charge him for that. You can't even admit it as evidence for mens rea. \n\nWe need to get real here. I'm not advocating for anything immediate, to do so now would be premature, and this isn't just to liberals but anyone who values self-determination and democracy. Hopefully if MAGA loses enough elections in a row the never Trumper conservatives can somehow take back control of the Republican party using as allies people that care more about winning than MAGA. Even so ...\n\n... we need to accept the process and the courts are not up to saving us indefinitely. You need to buy a gun. You need to compile a list of MAGA supporters in your neighborhood. When the system gets deadlocked we need a wave of violence to convince MAGA people to stop supporting these attempts to subvert Democracy because stealing an election to get everything they want isn't so much better than just getting some of the things they want from only sometimes winning elections because it's not worth the risk they may not survive the next wave of violence. \n\nWe cannot appeal to the better angels of their nature because they dont have any. They are Demons only forced to wear a mask of civility by society. Terror might work though. Better to have targeted violence than let us get dragged off the cliff with them.",

We citizens have our role to play in calling this out and resisting such unwarranted hysteria.\n\nTrump and his followers are trying to overthrow the constitution, under guise of protecting the constitution.  The followers appear to be gullible enough such that they are going to make a better effort at this than January 6.  Going by various news and analysis accounts, the overthrow attempt will be roughly:  \n\nA) Trump wins legitimately -> game over for US Constitution.  \nor\nB) The election is close - > Republicans are planning to refuse to certify the election at the local level in many jurisdictions.  They will not have grounds for this other than the imaginary election corruption that Trump has put forth, but it is the plan, as discussed by various sources, such as this just for one example:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/12/trump-overturn-result-presidential-election-vote\nIf they succeed in stopping the certification, then I am not sure how the country could get through it.\nor\nC) Trump clearly loses -> I think there will again be some concerted long-planned efforts to block certification, along with just general resistance.\n\nI also think some states will vote to secede, or there will be efforts to make this happen.\n\n------------\n\nMy personal comment is that there is no good justification for this sort of concerted plan to end the Constitution as we know it.  Yes, Democrats can be infuriating in how they handle (or refuse to think about) some of the issues, but they are by and large not stealing or corrupting any elections, and the accusations of doing so are simply one long dishoneststory arc game by some Republicans to sieze power and end our freedoms.  There is plenty of blame to go around for the situation we are in, but some of it must be leveled at the Republican followers who thought it was ok to fudge their understanding of the \"stolen election\" accusations.  Our country can't exist without free and fair elections and those elections actually have been pretty well free and fair (with some ongoing need for improvement) until the Republicans came along and decided to corrupt them under guise of claiming they were being cheated.  We would never let a child get away with this sort of obvious lie, but we the people have let the Republican stolen election deniliasts get away with their dishonest nonsense.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see is that listeners of the denialist radio and podcast show hosts stand up to the lies of those hosts.  No, there is not good reason to doubt the results of the last election.  A clear majority of voters, and a majority of the electoral college, was rightly counted as going for Biden and those who did not like this should suck it up and acknowledge that they lost, fairly and squarely, and that it's the American way to accept this.  If they honestly were so concerned with what a terrible President Biden supposedly is, and Harris supposedly will be, then they should have spent the last four years finding a way to nominate a really great alternative.  There are many fine smart-thinking Independents and Republicans who would have been dramatically better than Trump at opposing Harris.  Trump can only win with his appeal to base emotions and thoughts, cheap patriotism, and anti-intellectualism.  Yes, he makes partially good points on some issues, but so do other historic would-be fascist-dictator demagogues.  They're aware that to all good lies there is some truth, and to many good government overthrow attempts there is an appeal to some under-discussed issues.",

The Civil War in the US was an organized affair. Entire states submitted articles of succession detailing their reasons for wanting to secede from the union. The official state leadership and geographic lines made it possible to organize supplies, plan battles, etc. The fact that Southern states' economy was based largely around slavery gave the political leaders a unifying economic principle to organize around, and the geographic division between the North and the South made it possible to convince lower class Southern folks without slaves that this was a war about state rights or heritage (even though the official articles of secession made it clear that it was about slavery).\n\nNowadays every state in the US is a mixture of people with various political views. Cities lean more progressive, and rural areas lean more conservative, but you see variety within both those designations. The political leaders of the states represent both. They don't have any incentive to suddenly turn on all of their own cities or turn on their own rural population and start attacking them. So how would a civil war play out?",

You can't just lump maga as whole. You disregard half the population if u do. Just like you can't lump all democrats as pro Hamas or extremely left. By doing that you shut down any chance for there to be an open dialog and a way to unite the nation. This is not me supporting Trump perse. Just facts. If I had to choose a candidate Kennedy. He has good policy ideas, decent support, and nobody hates him so he can unite us. Trumps made misogynistic remarks, and has too much baggage to to unite us or get anything done. kamala changes her accent depending on the demographic area of her rally, flip flop on policy's, and just overall sketch.",

Stochastic terrorist elements, though? Absolutely. The right has lost its collective mind. Or, rather, they are just reverting to the right-wing norm of violence towards political ends until they get their wish of fundamentally unequal application of \"legitimate\" violence (e.g. the state) along racial and religious axes.\n\nCivil War, though? I'd doubt it. I don't think there's that level of right-wing loyalty in the military, and the military has been a pretty professional and shockingly inclusive organization for awhile now. There are LGBT service members, black and female service members, and many service members from pro-labor backgrounds or who hail from Democratic-leaning cities and states. There just wouldn't be the level of unity needed for there to be any organized opposition, even within the same unit.\n\n>On Truth Social, users have expressed their willingness to take drastic actions, with comments like, “If they steal the election again, we won’t just march on the Capitol, we’ll take our country back by any means necessary.”\n\nThey said the same shit in 2020. And some of them meant it, to be sure. Those ones are probably serving prison terms for explicit and actionable threats and/or actual actions taken. There will be those again, and there will be those probably for every Presidential election cycle for awhile to come. \n\nI don't think we'll ever truly be rid of it, sadly, and at the risk of stating something wildly unpopular, there are aspects of conservative cultural ideology that aren't entirely untrue. I DO think you probably do need some shared culture, of which language is undoubtedly a central part, that defines a nation as distinct. Conservatives are not wrong to point that out, or to point out some problems with our immigration system, etc. The problem with them is that right now they start from that point, and take it... just... off the fucking deep end, with pretty open-and-shut insinuations that black people or LGBT people cannot be share in that culture, or that women cannot be part of professional society, etc.\n\nLike that shit is just wild, and that's what the culture war is. The right *absolutely* seeks to return to an era of institutional bigotry codified textually in laws. I would argue that the left's case that the U.S. is still institutionally bigoted obviously has some merit, we've seen the incarceration statistics, we've seen disparity in funding for inner city schools versus ones in affluent white suburbia, we've seen the inequity in callbacks for resumes featuring \"black sounding\" names, etc. It's real, but there is at least a case to be made that it isn't *textually* codified in the law anymore, we're just working to mitigate the downstream cultural effects that persist after centuries of that textual, statutory inequality.\n\nThe contemporary right is fighting to return to that textual, statutory inequality, and the contemporary left is fighting to excise the remaining cultural inequality from our society and institutions. That's the culture war, and the right *correctly* understands that their hopes and dreams for a fundamentally unequal society DO INDEED face an existential crisis. I don't lose my fucking mind when I read about a gay character in a book, or when someone doesn't go to church (like me), or when I see a gay couple holding hands in the museum - but right-wingers 100% do. Your business is *very much* their business, this is central to the right's ideology.",

Trump got the blame because he started the issue, but the mishandling of the situation at private, judicial, and government levels escalated the situation to that point. Unfortunately, because Trump took the whole blame for this situation no issues were addressed to ensure future election legitimacy.\nThat being said, it’d probably be more subdued this coming jan 6 because security wouldn’t be as mishandled like it was by mayor Bowser in 2020. In turn the leftover and new lack of trust in elections, not just by Trump supporters, will lead to protests and may have enough support to declare the federal government defunct by many red states. A civil war scenario from that point would rely on how heavy handed the federal government would be to ensure compliance.",

I think a debt strike could be a powerful tool where even the creditable threat could be a powerful leaver of power. If they want to take my rights away, then I don't feel obligated to honor private debt obligations. To be abundantly clear, this would not include public debt such as taxes / fees /  dues, etc. They can and will throw you in prison for not paying taxes. What they can't do is throw you in prison for not paying medical debt. We can phrase this as a contractual disagreement. \n\nAnother potential tool would be a general strike, which almost happened on January 6th. As in one of the top leadership of a union was discussing the possibility, but that was not the direction they went. If armed force is deployed against Trumps opponents, then I think this would be needed. If people just didn't show up to work, they would need to deploy forces to make people work. That might make sense for high-level federal positions, but if you are at the bottom of the economic ladder, it won't be feasible.\n\n\nBoth of these non-violent tactics have risks, and we would need to organize them to try and mitigate those risks. So I think even if we hesitate to push those big red buttons, it's still important that the capacity is there and that we communicate what risks they would face very clearly. If they don't know we are organizing this, then it won't be a deterant until we use it, and by then, it's too late in some ways. We must change their political calculations to include this potential existential risk to their personal wealth.",

Democratic politicians as well as activists and other ‘liberal’ citizens have made multiple comments on a possible CW in Trump wins. On Jan 6, it was (D) Pelosi’s responsibility to have guards around the Capitol, not any Republican’s. Pelosi admits this on a recording while travelling on a vehicle, it’s easy to google. Also, Trump also said to his people to “protest peacefully” on Jan 6. Anyone has the right to protest inside the Capitol and that’s why the police were letting most of them in. The pro Palestinian people were in there twice since the war started. The only occasion when anyone who worked there have died in the Capitol because of a protest was when Puerto Rican separatists have gone in there to kill people back in the day. Those people have been pardoned by President Clinton for your information. On Jan 6, there was an unarmed protestor shot by police, that’s it. No, no police has died on the day. And this is why the situation is extremely dangerous, you guys,the Democrats and the Republicans are living in parallel realities. In my opinion there is higher chance for violence if Trump wins, much more so if he loses, just for seeing both of those parallel realities and how people who live in them behaving in their everyday lives.

They study, in some depth, the political, philosophical, psychological, economic, and societal factors behind military conflicts, including the Civil War.

As they were being overwhelmed they were able to get support from the metro PD although MPD didn't go into the day thinking they would be needed. There were Maryland National Guard standing by but they couldn't cross into DC without pentagon permission and that came way too late. There was also a sense from the insurrectionists that they would win and then there wouldn't be consequences because Trump would pardon them.\n\nEven if there is another big march on the Capitol the police presence will be insane and both Capitol Police and Metro PD will be well prepared.

Let’s say it’s Georgia, but the state electors in Trump’s pocket simply to refuse to certify even though there is no evidence of fraud- they simply say they *believe* there was fraud. It works its way thru everything until it goes to the Supreme Court and they twist the law to allow such an injustice. \n\nThe entire time that is happening there is still a Democrat in the executive branch. \n\nWe need to realize that simply “not listening” to the corrupt decision and refusing to vacate office is a real option for Democrats in this scenario. Republicans had their shot on Jan 6 but weren’t prepared yet, nobody could have been. \n\nThis would be, of course, an unprecedented constitutional crisis for sure- but the idea of Trump somehow simply refusing to verify the election, AND getting away with it, seems far-fetched. \n\nBut that’s just Civil War 2.0 with more steps.",

Modern civil wars are more like insurgencies, terrorism, & guerilla warfare with targeted assassinations of politicians & judges, bombing public places like Walmart or schools, and hit & run ambushes of police & military. They are trying to force the population to choose sides, in part by demonstrating to citizens that the government cannot keep them safe or provide basic necessities. The insurgents are trying to prove that they are the ones who should have political power; they are the ones who should rule. The goal is to incite a broader civil war, by denigrating the state and growing support for extreme measures.  The more pain they inflict on average citizens, the more likely governments would be to make concessions to the terrorists in exchange for peace. Another strategy is intimidation. If you cannot topple the central gov., then you can use violence to goad the population directly into submission. Targeted violence can be used to intimidate agents of the federal gov. -- law enforcement personnel, civil servants, members of Congress, and the judiciary -- convincing them not to enforce existing rules. That's one of the things that death threats are designed to do. Violent extremists can target and kill liberal politicians who have voted in favor of gun control, judges who have ruled in favor of abortion rights, or police officers who protect immigrants' civil liberties. But they also target moderate Republicans who do not toe the extremists' line. Militants become a form of vigilantism designed to prevent the implementation of social change. \n\nExpect small groups to operate independently across the country. These cells will try to stay under the radar. These groups may compete to see who can be more extreme and brutal.\n\nIncreasingly, civil wars involve some type of ethnic cleansing, and there is every reason to suspect that this is where an escalating campaign of far-right terror in the US would lead. A country doesn't need a large percentage of the population to be involved for violent ethnic cleansing to occur. Small numbers of heavily armed citizens -- together with help from law enforcement and the military -- are often enough.\n\nAmerica's extremists today subscribe to an idea known as *accelerationism*: the apocalyptic belief that modern society is irredeemable and that its end must by hastened so that a new order can be brought into being. They are looking for any excuse to incite conflict. The hope is this will set off a chain reaction of violence, which will in turn cause moderate citizens -- their eyes now open to government oppression and social injustice -- to join their cause. \n\nMost countries that were able to avoid a civil war shared an ability to strengthen the quality of their governance. They doubled down on democracy. \n\nThere is so much more in the book. I highly recommend reading it.",

Even outside the US, \"actively beating cops with makeshift weapons\" is probably getting you shot under any normal circumstance. \n\nNotice how, when they got past the cops and reached the Secret Service (who are better armed, better trained and do not fuck around), literally the first person to try and breach was shot dead.

The only reason the whole Senate got out before the rioters reached the chambers is one cop steered them away from the Senate doors. \n\nThere is a very real scenario where Democratic members of congress or a \"RINO\" like Mitt Romney take a wrong turn and get beaten to death by a mob.",

                "comment_body": "Here are some of my sources, alongside some more rambling and justifications for the above on my side.  \n\nFor convict leasing, the best concise source of information I’ve found is actually [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4kI2h3iotA), which heavily references Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II (2010) by Douglas A. Blackmon\n\nAs far as the reframing of Reconstruction, this is covered directly by the PBS documentary [Reconstruction: The Second Civil War](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/reconstruction/).  \n\nI would normally try to refer to a scholarly article or point on the 1876 election. However, I found most of what I saw entirely lacking. They focus on the mundane aspects of the election and the compromise to end the constitutional crisis, and rarely address WHY it was disputed or the tactics used to dispute it.\n\nFor example, violence is basically not covered in the first halves of *Centennial crisis: The disputed election of 1876* by Rehnquist or *By one vote: the disputed presidential election of 1876* by Holt.\n\nWhat isn’t covered?\n\nThe [Hamburg Massacre](https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/hamburg-massacre/), among uncountably many others.  Or things like the March 1876 ruling in *United States v. Cruikshank* which  tossed out convictions of three white men charged with violating the 1870 Enforcement Act.\n\nLet me explain how disastrous that was.  The Supreme Court overturned the convictions on the grounds that the Enforcement Acts only applied to actions by the state. In other words, the federal government was unlawfully interfering by prosecuting the people responsible.\n\nWhat were they responsible for, you may ask?\n\nOnly the **mass murder** of Black people, on political grounds, by armed white militias like the KKK (the 1871 Enforcement Act was also called the KKK Act). Effectively, if white Democrats controlled the apparatus of state government, it was legal for mobs to kill any number of Black people.\n\nSpecifically, this case was over the Colfax massacre, where a group of armed white men murdered an estimated 150 Black men.  After a skirmish between a Black militia and a white militia over a contested gubernatorial election, the Black militia surrendered and were subsequently massacred. \n\nWhether a result of historical revisionism, or scholarly ineptitude, there is no established casualty count for the frequent and largely unchecked murders during the Reconstruction period. White newspapers often suppressed reports of white violence, and most modern readings still use those newspapers as the primary source of first-hand documentation over this time period.\n\nI believe that the [Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org/report/reconstruction-in-america/documenting-reconstruction-violence/) has the best and most exhaustive documentation of the violence in this era. They documented nearly 2,000 racial terror lynchings and 34 documented racial massacres during this time period\n\nIn all likelihood, tens of thousands were murdered and hundreds of thousands injured by these lynchings and massacres, largely focused on regaining control of elections.\n\nThe KKK and other militias acted as the military wing of the Democratic Party. For example, take Georgia.  In 1868, the legislature expelled its Black members, resisted federal efforts to reseat them, and used the KKK to ‘redeem’ the state.  \n\n[One-quarter](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/black-legislators-during-reconstruction/) of those Black legislators were publically killed, threatened, beaten, or jailed.  Subsequently, Democrats won an overwhelming majority in 1870, a result of literally being able to kill their opponents without prosecution. Even the Black majority areas simply saw their elected representatives not seated. The last of these was W. H. Rogers in 1906, before Black voters were legally disenfranchised in 1908. \n\nThis ‘redemption’ is the source of modern Southern pride. We can see how they interpreted this in *The Birth of Nation*, which was originally called *The Clansman.* In that movie, the KKK is depicted as a heroic force.  The movie’s protagonist is portrayed as the founder of the KKK, and their praiseworthy actions include the lynching of Black men, and lining up armed and mounted to intimidate Black people and prevent them from voting in an election.\n\nIt was not the Confederacy that was praised.  While there was much rationalization and romanticism over the antebellum South, this was a very clear example of the actual ascendant forces that gave Southern states their pride back: white militias that murdered and intimidated their way back into white supremacy.",

Sure, your absolutely right, rural America is being left behind and nothing is going to stop that. They should be concerned because entire swaths of their parts of the country are depopulating, losing resources, access to medical care, etc. The cold hard reality is that nothing is going to stop that. They've voted against every progressive policy that could have possibly helped them and after decades of Republican control, no innovation, etc. they are reaping what they have sown. \n\nBut you see the problem comes with the next step. The \"action\" part of this new Civil War. These are some of the most lazy, unorganized, and old people that I know. Some of the members of my extended family haven't exercised since they were 20 and their entire life consists of sleeping, eating, and watching TV between eating and sleeping. These are going to be the people to rise up against the United States government? No. They are going to do what they always do. Bitch and moan. Bitching and moaning about the world outside their rural bubble is their greatest past time. Obama got elected? Tons of bitching and moaning. Trump lost to Biden? Tons of bitching and moaning. But they all did it from their Lay-Z-Boy recliners or at the local diner where all the other old and sedentary elderly folks gather to bitch and moan.\n\nHowever, if you were to suggest something that requires actual \"effort\" to solve any of their problems, you would quickly find that all of the sudden they aren't really feeling all the revolutionary. The closest a lot of these people have come to conflict is yelling at their televisions or people online. The reality is they live in their insular bubble of hate and ignorance and so long as they can shout into the void with their fellow hateful and ignorant kin, that's enough for them. They don't actually care enough to do anything because they honestly don't care that much. It's like a weird type of drama for them, like if politics was reality TV.",

May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.\n\nWhat do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?",

If she loses, I don't think there were many ways for her to win.\n\n**Siphoning the Vote** \n\nMy biggest fear regardless of who wins is that the takeaway will be spoiler candidates are useful to winning elections. If there is a sudden influx of candidates vying for the ballot in 2028, its likely because both parties have decided that siphoning off voters is a more effective electoral strategy. With increased political polarization and more reliable voting by Democrats, the new \"meta\" could easily become to bring up and argue against less viable candidates so they get more press. \n\nIn 2020, Jo Jorgensen ran and while it's not fair to say that they swung the election, it is plausible that Arizona, Wisconsin, and Georgia - which would have been enough for Trump to win - could have played a difference. The litmus for whether this is a viable strategy could very well come out of the differences in Trump's performance with Kennedy on and not on the ballot. That said, this will likely be a losing game for Democrats in the long run unless they embrace ranked-choice voting Democratic leaning and swing States. \n\nTL:DR: The need to change electoral strategies \n\n**Personality** \n\nWalz has been super effective and has incredibly high favorability. His policies help, but it's mostly because he has a strong personality. The main time Harris has had major flubs in my opinion is when she got into policy specifics. There's basically no incentive to give more than an outline of policy goals because it can only be used against you to a certain portion of your coalition. While I don't think Harris is like Hillary, I can almost guarantee that that will be the comparison made, if she loses. I also think unfortunately - and most likely without actual warrant  - there will be hesitation to select a woman as the nominee again for some time and that'll play a part in the post-election discussion.\n\nTL;DR: The need to focus even less on policy and running more on having a strong personality\n\n**Issues Impacting Men**\n\nThis is going to sound silly to some because a lot of the issues men are facing are a byproduct of their resistance to things like mental healthcare and higher education. The election is bound to be highly gendered and if Trump wins, it's likely because Harris' campaign focused on women's issues in a way that a good portion of men felt attacked and thought of it as a zero-sum game - and therefore energized them to vote for Trump. By 2028, I think while women's issues aren't going anywhere, I think one of the main tonal changes will be in how a Democratic win is a win for men - especially single men, and/or those struggling to pay child support. For example, I'd argue that suggesting things like scaled subsidies for child support for those men who consistently make payments would both be a win for single mother's as it'd encourage more consistent payments and feeds into the desire to be a breadwinner, but in a positive way. \n\nTL;DR: Lack of direct messaging to older single and separated men. \n\n**The Economy** \n \nI think this will be discussed, but looking a the local economies relative to voting patterns will inform whether the discussion has merit. I'm not completely convinced.",

There’s a wide range of reasons for the popularity. \n- Read someone say they will blame youth turnout (as usual).\n- It’s hard to tell if there is genuine interest in Harris, or it’s an echo chamber. She seems more charismatic now than when she ran. But I struggle to think about what she’s done while in her position. I’m not that involved in politics though.

At that time, Harris had focused her campaign almost entirely on SC but, by withdrawing her candidacy before the SC primary, she opened the door for a significant Biden win in the state that played a huge part in breathing life into his campaign but left her largely unknown to the electorate.\n\nHarris' performance as Vice President has been largely unremarkable, with national coverage generally critical over her performance the past 3-3/4 years, pointing out her ineffectiveness with respect to the border, staff turnover of 90% amid remarks that she bullied staff, and the occasional \"word salad.\"     \n\nNow there are vague suggestions that she's changed the positions she took in 2020, but she is seemingly disavowing the positions of the Biden administration as well.  She's offered various sweeteners -- $50,000 to startups, the elimination of tax on tips and, as a sop to wealthy donors, a capital gains tax rate substantially lower than what Biden has proposed -- but her refusal to be interviewed or clearly and unequivocally address her positions has left her a cipher to many.  \n\nI would lay a Harris defeat at the feet of both the DNC and her campaign.  If the party had been willing to acknowledge Biden's decline and Harris and others had been given a meaningful opportunity to either primary Biden (which is not unheard of; Ted Kennedy, for example, primaried incumbent president Jimmy Carter) or openly vie for the nomination once Biden withdrew, I think voters would be much more comfortable with the Democratic candidate.  (As I understand it, this was not possible since the Biden-Harris campaign had accumulated an enormous war chest before it became imminently clear to all that Biden was not re-electable and, as a practical matter, Harris was the only heir to those funds.)  But I would fault her campaign as well, which seems to be following the same strategy Democrats followed in keeping Biden's condition from public view.  In combination with the vagueness around her positions, I think those things would all play a significant part in any Harris loss.",

There’s only so much democrats can do in this situation, however knocking doors, making phone calls, talking to your friends, family, and neighbors can make all the difference.

Then she tried to make up for it be a news blitz but only came off as unprepared to handle tough questions.\n\nThe \"Hitler\" is a new low political warfare that seems to have backfired.

You cant compare the U.S. inflation rate to the E.U. inflation rate because they use different methods for calculating it.\n\nRepublicans changed how inflation was measured in the 90s to benefit large corporations and Democrats have refused to change it back ever since.  It literally only exists to defraud people out of just wages and benefits.  The modern U.S. CPI does not take into account any rural consumer prices or housing.  It doesnt take into consideration rapidly rising homeowners insurance costs, or costs to food affected by climate change and weather.  Much of your true cost of living simply isnt accounted for by the inflation rate, the cost of living that is rising on a daily basis at a rapid rate.\n\nBiden did do a terrible job.  He reappointed Trumps, Powell the man who used quantitative easing during the pandemic to inflate the money supply by trillions of dollars more than necessary to cover the spending.  Specifically to pay off the debt of the 1% and promote the smash and grab style methods of private equity.  Biden saw this happen during the Obama administration when the Federal Reserve used quantitative easing, and he saw the negative effect it had on our country.  So why the fuck did he reappoint Powell and then stack his cabinet full of investment management and private equity people?\n\nIn the aftermath that smash and grab consolidation of business by large corporations, the manufacturing of supply chains to increase revenue....That is the norm, that has become a standard business practice under Biden.  The 1% has transferred, continues to transfer an enormous amount of wealth from the bottom 90% to the top.  With large corporations destroying healthy businesses for the benefit of shareholders, to the detriment of the entire country.\n\nHarris is directly following suit with her policies, doubling down on the worst parts of Bidens administration.  Voters were not allowed to have a primary, they were not given any choice.  You look at her support of Israel and Walz, a man who openly supports genocide as defined by the United Nations.  Israeli IDF just assassinated an unarmed American citizen in the West Bank of Palestine for protesting an illegal settlement, shot her in the back of the head.  And what has been the response from Biden or Harris?  Nothing. \n\nHarris is losing grasp of a significant demographic due to refusing to abandon the policies of the Biden administration.  Misrepresenting the economics of the U.S. and global politics doesnt do Democrats any favors...All it really does is sabotage the party, there is no guilting already angry and apathetic voters into voting.  Democrats have to change their platform and strategy if they want to continue to be relevant in the very near future.\n\nWalz was about the most brain dead choice their campaign could have ever made, there were plenty of potential people who looked like Walz who do not openly support the illegal settlements in Palestine.  Go look at Dennis Heck.  Hes an older pudgy white guy that people like who doesnt openly support war crimes...  \n\nBy refusing to acknowledge the reality that U.S. inflation is far worse than being reported, that the U.S. consumer price index should be far higher than is being reported, Democrats are handing Trump a political victory.  Our economy is not made up of the limited stock exchanges of a couple thousand multinational corporations, our economy is made up of the tens of millions of American businesses that are being pillaged and looted by these corporate pirates.  You combine the bleak economic outlook most people have in our country with the anger coming from people who feel disenfranchised in addition to those who are revolted about U.S. support for Israel...Harris is not winning the election.  Democrats still need support from the roughly 9 million rural pro gun Democrats and if there is renewed support of future assault weapon bans and increasingly strict gun control, that only suppresses even more votes.  \n\nIn order for Harris to win she has to do a 180 on Bidens policies and get Walz to shut up.",

The Trump campaign is struggling to land punches against Harris and her VP pick has been received much better than Trump's. If anything, Harris' campaign' refreshing approach to date has flipped the \"old\" / \"senile\" narrative used by the GOP against Biden on its head.\n\nClearly was a high-risk strategy (though one could argue downside was limited with Trump/GOP far ahead in the polls at that time), but so far so good for Democrats; it couldn't have gone any better in helping turn the tide. It could all change by next Tuesday of course but so far the Democratic Party has handled the transition very well.\n\nI also feel like Harris is far from being a strong candidate, so introducing her earlier in the year would have given the GOP much more time to plan around her.",

Firstly, neither side is targeting a win in the popular vote so it's not really relevant. Republicans have effectively targeted a rural voterbase. This will not win you the popular vote and if a voting system was changed, the Republicans would either have to abandon that rural base and adapt pro choice and anti gun policies for example to appeal to the more progressive and urban voters which would win you the elections. It would turn into a scenario where you're turning the big cities other than battleground states and this really isn't an improvement.\n\nSome other forms of voting would be better but while the two party system exists I think it's much better than the only other realistic option which is popular vote.",

There are a few things that are more boring than watching a politician vomit out there little memorized stump speeches for friendly influencers and hit easy questions lobbed to them. Nothing about that format is going to convince someone who is convincible to agree with you. They don't want to watch such boring and safe discussions, and it isn't like they are really going to learn anything anyways. \n\nIf you don't see the candidate in a stressed position, you are just going to get the marketing machine. A large part of Donald Trump's appeal is that he isn't a marketing machine. He says wild, crazy, and exciting stuff in a way that draws attention and controversy. He at least has the possibility to sway people because people tend to hear him.  Granted, he also tends to sway people away from him for almost exactly the same reason, but he can move the needle. Further, Donald Trump offers something distinctly new. \"I'm going to go on a revenge campaign against those assholes over there that hurt you\" was something new that Republicans had never really hurt before. It galvanized a whole bunch of aggrieved people who really wanted to go hurt those people over there. It was convincing, at least to some.\n\nWith Harris, I don't see how she convinces anyone. She is basically just playing for turnout at this point. She doesn't have some radical new perspective like Donald Trump. She doesn't speak in a way to convince people that she is going to offer something radical and new, like Obama did. She is just there, trying to look as inoffensively acceptable and sane. She has no coherent argument that voters care about, beyond \"I'm not Donald Trump, and I am a functioning adult that will act normally\". That's not a bad message to start with, as it will get you a certain number of people who are on the more moderate and conservative end of the spectrum that wouldn't normally align with Harris, but really don't like Donald Trump. It just doesn't get you very far beyond that.\n\nPut another way, if you had to ask someone why do you want Harris rather than someone else? What makes Harris uniquely special? I think most people will be stumped. I don't think she's done a very good job making the case, I think she's just done a very good job drawing a sharp contrast between her and Donald Trump, and while that's good enough for most people that might be inclined to vote Democrat, it's certainly not going to shake out any new coalitions the way Donald Trump and Obama did.",

Plus, the party did hold a vote and no one even opposed Harris. True, Biden being pushed out is a troublesome event, but ultimately it was biden's choice and the person he endorsed as his successor did in fact succeed him.\n\nBut as your post said, to some, it \"fEeLs\" wrong (mostly because they didn't get what they wanted).",

It’s as long as the Democrats don’t take office they’ll use their strongest hand (or at least the perceived version of it) to get a hold of, keep and consolidate political power. It shouldn’t be much surprise that the most galvanizing (R) presidential candidate since Reagan has this much mainstream support. It’s not a coincidence the few remaining moderate Republicans have been shooed out of office in favor of those who will toe the line. Criminality, ethics, corruption are all after thoughts to the GOP. This isn’t novel to Trump either.

Whether or not you personally feel the results were fine the question here was about what narrative will be pointed to in the event of a Harris loss.\n\nThe reality is many voters felt totally disenfranchised by Biden being selected without any real primary - no candidate other than Biden had ballot access in all 50 states, many states ONLY had Biden as an option, Biden refused to participate in any primary debates and the DNC actually shut down several events for fringe candidates opposing him.\n\nThe justification for this is that parties always run the incumbent but now they aren't even running the incumbent candidate and just selected Harris.\n\nI think it is absolutely a good thing that Biden dropped out and selecting Harris was both the best strategic decision and likely the most legally justified. However I think it was absolutely a mistake not engaging with the primaries from the start which would have exposed Biden's weak performance ahead of time and this never would have been an issue.\n\nThe perception of illegitimacy to Harris's nomination will definitely hurt her in the general election whether or not you think that perception is justified. I don't think it will hurt enough to cost her the election but it's still not great.",

I live in a semi rural area far outside of Atlanta, and every week can hear 50 to 500 rounds go off. Target shooting with rapid fire rifles is a real sport for millions. They must love it because I don’t think it is cheap to fire hundreds of rounds a month.",
